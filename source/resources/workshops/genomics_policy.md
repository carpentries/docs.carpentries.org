## Submitting a Genomics Workshop

1. Self-Organised Data Carpentry Genomics workshops in which organisers would like The Carpentries to provide AWS instances must be submitted using the Self-Organised {{'[workshop submission form]({}/forms/self-organised/)'.format(amy_link)}} at least five weeks before the workshop start date. Workshops submitted less than five weeks in advance will not be provided instances.  
2. Centrally-Organised Data Carpentry Genomics workshops should be submitted using the {{'[Centrally-Organised workshop request form]({}/forms/request_workshop/)'.format(amy_link)}}, following the timeline previously outlined on the {{"[Carpentries website]({}/workshops/host-workshop/#request-a-centrally-organised-workshop)".format(carpentries_website)}}.

## Pricing

1. A Data Carpentry Genomics workshop can be planned as a two or four-day event with 20, 30, or 45 instances. The workshop must occur on consecutive days. Pricing depends upon a combination of the number of days the workshop will take place and the number of AWS instances being provided, as shown in the table below. All prices are in US dollars.  
   

|  | 20 Instances | 30 Instances | 45 Instances |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Two Day** | $300 | $400 | $500 |
| **Four Day** | $400 | $500 | $600 |

2. In addition to the pricing reflected in the table, Centrally-Organised Data Carpentry Genomics workshops include an administrative fee, found on the {{"[Pricing]({}/support/pricing/#workshop-pricing)".format(carpentries_website)}} page of our website.    
3. Workshops in which the organiser sets up AWS instances independently will not be charged for AWS instances by The Carpentries.

## Invoicing

1. Once your workshop has been submitted, please allow up to five business days for an invoice to be issued.  
2. The invoice for your workshop will be issued through CxORE LLC, a partner organisation that provides The Carpentries’ back-office support.  
3. Invoices for Self-Organised workshops must be paid in full at least two weeks before the start of the workshop. Invoices not paid at least two weeks before the start of the workshop will be voided and AWS instances will not be provided.

To stay in accordance with invoicing for Centrally-Organised workshops, 50% of the Fee shall be due upon execution of the [Workshop Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j514V4lAB2EefNPTrELHQdIQRlfb2fIW26tTdLcZ-mc/edit?tab=t.0), and shall be non-refundable. The remaining 50% of the Fee shall be due and payable to The Carpentries upon completion of the Services.  
5. Payment can be made using credit card, check, or wire transfer.

## Service
