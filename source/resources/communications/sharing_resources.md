# A Guide to Sharing Communications with The Carpentries

The Carpentries welcomes blog posts, newsletter announcements, social media posts, and other communications requests from our community members, including workshop hosts, learners, and others. 

## Sharing a blog post 

### Writing and Formatting Your Blog Post

Please draft your blog post using [The Carpentries Blog Post Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iUUOHkpGm1H7OPYLtYRSeTFw08ctMbak4k1j6Xp5C-U/edit?tab=t.0). 

Please follow the [Carpentries Style Guide](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/style-guide.html) when writing your blog post. Pay special attention to guidelines regarding abbreviations, acronyms, capitalisation, and use of inclusive language (e.g., remove ableist language). In addition, 

* Add descriptive alt text to all images included in your post.   
* Avoid excessive use of italics, underlines, or all caps.  
* For images that are not photos, use an online contrast checker (example) to check that the text and background colours have sufficient contrast to comply with accessibility standards.  
* If your communication includes videos, provide accurate captions and transcripts for the content.  
* Make sure that links and buttons are clearly labelled and distinguishable. Avoid using generic phrases like "click here" instead of descriptive text.

When defining terminology popular with The Carpentries community, please use the definitions in our [Community Glossary of Terms](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/general/glossary.html).  

### Single-Authored Blog Post Writing

Do you have an idea you would like to develop and publish as a blog post?

* Email community@carpentries.org with your idea, and one of the Core Team members will discuss it with you and also guide you through submitting it to our blog. 

### Collaborative Blog Post Writing

Are you interested in collaborating with another community member to co-author and publish a post on The Carpentries blog?

* Join The Carpentries Slack and share your blog post idea in the \#blog-post-ideas channel to start a discussion. Invite other community members to collaborate with you. (***preferred***)  
* Email community@carpentries.org with your idea, and one of the Core Team members will amplify the concept in the community so others can reach out and collaborate with you. (***optional***)

## Sharing a Newsletter Update 

Do you have an announcement you would like us to include in [*Carpentries Clippings*](https://carpentries.org/about-us/newsletter/), our monthly newsletter? Announcements could be job opportunity openings, a special update from your subcommunity or an event that might interest the community. 

* Email [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org) with your request; we will include it in the next newsletter.   
* Please note that the **newsletter is released on the 4th (not last) Thursday of the month**. Please bear this in mind when sending time-sensitive notices.
