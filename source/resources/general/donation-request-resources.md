Email Subject Line: A Call to Action: Help The Carpentries Meet Our Fundraising Goal

Dear \[potential donor’s name\]

My name is \[your name\], and I am the \[position or role at your institution\]. I am also \[position or role\] with The Carpentries, an organisation whose mission is to build global capacity in essential data and computational skills. The Carpentries helps train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research.

The Carpentries is in the process of [transitioning out of fiscal sponsorship](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/08/Carpentries-transition-to-independent-status/) to operate as an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation, and is seeking donations from individuals who wish to support its desire for independence to carry out its global mission. This move towards independence will empower The Carpentries to have greater autonomy, allowing it the flexibility to innovate, experiment, and respond swiftly to emerging trends and challenges in data science and education. 

**You can support our transition to independence by donating any amount.** 

The Carpentries supports more than 3,000 highly skilled Instructors in communities in over 100 countries across the world. We have experience training educators, researchers, librarians, and technologists. We are working to scale our instructor training and curriculum development programs to respond to the shift in the nature of education around the world. **Now more than ever we need you to champion our mission**. You can help us teach data skills to the communities that need them most by donating any amount you feel comfortable with.

Donating even a small amount can make a big difference \- we value all contributions. Your donation will allow The Carpentries to scale as an independent tax-exempt non-profit organisation,and will help bring Carpentries programming to individuals who might otherwise have barriers to participation.

If you are interested in supporting The Carpentries’ mission of teaching data skills globally, [please visit our Donate page](https://give.communityin.org/TheCarpentries?ref=ab_3na6QVGVLAI3na6QVGVLAI) to give any amount you are comfortable with.

Thank you so much\!

Sincerely,  
\[Your name\]  
\[Your role within The Carpentries\]
