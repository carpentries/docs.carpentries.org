Dear [potential donor’s name],

My name is [your name], and I am a [position or role] with The Carpentries. Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

The importance of digital skills is undeniable; educators and organisations are collaborating to support effective instructional strategies, and with your help, The Carpentries is primed to thrive in this environment. Our instructors run weekly workshops worldwide to teach our established digital skills curricula, but our work is never finished, and we want to do much more.

The Carpentries supports more than 4,200 highly skilled instructors in communities in 65 countries worldwide. We have experience training educators, researchers, librarians, and technologists. We have scaled our instructor training and curriculum development programs to respond to the shifts in education worldwide. __Now more than ever, we need you to champion our mission__. You can help us teach data skills to the communities that need them most by donating any amount you feel comfortable with.

__Our goal is to raise $5,000 in individual contributions quarterly. Will you help us get there?__

Donating even a small amount can make a big difference - we value all contributions. Your donation will allow The Carpentries to expand into new geographies and disciplines and help bring workshops to individuals who might otherwise have barriers to participation.

If you want to support The Carpentries’ mission of teaching data skills globally, [please visit our giving page](https://give.communityin.org/TheCarpentries) and donate any amount you are comfortable with.
Thank you so much!

Sincerely,  
[Your name]  
[Your role within The Carpentries]
