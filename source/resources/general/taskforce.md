## The Carpentries Task Force Guidelines

These guidelines provide the recommended process for establishing a task force to ensure transparency, accountability, and sustainability of task forces' activities.

### Task Force Proposal
A task force proposal should:
- explain the need for or the context of the task force
- list the aims and objectives of the task force
- set a timeline for starting and completing the task force's activities/deliverables.

Task force proposals can be submitted by [creating an
issue](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/issues) in the 
[*task forces* repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) in [The Carpentries GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/) or
by emailing the proposal to the [Core Team](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

### Task Force Formation
Task force proposals do not require formal approval, though the [Core Team should be informed](mailto:team@carpentries.org) of task force formation. Active task forces are listed in [The Carpentries task forces repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) with a link to its public documentation.

### Task Force Operations
The following are recommended guidelines for committees. Each committee should:

- Create the official [task force charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/task-force-charter-template.md), 
including the task force's roles and responsibilities
- Appoint the task force chair and, optionally, a co-chair
- Request a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend the task force meetings
- Create a public space for the task force, including:
  - The task force's charter and its current status (e.g., active, completed)
  - Contact information for the task force
  - Other public materials (if available)
  - Information on when the task force meetings are held
  - Meeting notes (if appropriate)
  - Name of the Core Team liaison 
  - Information on how to apply to join the task force
- Create internal [documentation for operational procedures](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/task-force-charter-template.md#task-force-charter-name-of-task-force) (which may also be made public), including:
  - Process for recruiting and/or selecting new members
  - Decision-making process
- Maintain internal and public-facing communication:
  - Organise regular meetings to progress with the task force's activities and post meeting notes in a consistent location (meeting notes should be public unless the work of the task force requires them to remain private)
  - Post meetings in the community calendar (note that meetings do not necessarily need to be open to the public to attend even though they are added to the calendar)
  - Utilise other [Carpentries community communication pathways](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html) to engage with the community as needed

The task force's public documentation should be stored in a folder within the [`task-forces` repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) 
in [The Carpentries GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/).

### Task Force Termination
A task force will naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its goals, in which case the Core Team should be notified. 

### Past & Current Task Forces

- [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://carpentries.org/carp-con-tf/) - a recurring task force that gets periodically
  reformed to organise the international [CarpentryCon](https://carpentries.org) conference on behalf of The Carpentries.
- Other past and current task forces can be found in [The Carpentries Task Force Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces).
