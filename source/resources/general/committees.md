# The Carpentries Committee Guidelines

These guidelines provide the recommended process for creating committees to ensure transparency, accountability, and sustainability of committee activities.

## Committee Proposal
A committee proposal should:
- explain the need for or the context for the committee
- explain why it should be an ongoing/longer-term committee
- list the aims and objectives of the committee

Committee proposals can be submitted by creating an
issue in the [*committees* repository](https://github.com/carpentries/committees/issues) in [The Carpentries GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/) or by emailing the proposal to the [Core Team](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

## Committee Formation
Committee proposals do not require formal approval, though the [Community Team should be informed](mailto:community@carpentries.org) of committee formation. Active committees are listed on [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/committees/) with a link to public documentation.

## Committee Operations
The following are recommended guidelines for committees. Each committee should:

- Create an official [committee charter](https://github.com/carpentries/committees/blob/main/committee-charter-template.md), including the [committee's roles and responsibilities](https://github.com/carpentries/committees/blob/main/committee-charter-template.md#roles-and-responsibilities)
- Appoint a committee chair and, optionally, a co-chair and identify term limits for chair/co-chair/members
- Request a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend the committee meetings
- Create a public space for the committee, including:
  - The committee's charter
  - Contact information for the committee
  - Other public materials (if available)
  - Information on when committee meetings are held
  - Meeting notes (if appropriate)
  - Names of the current and past members, including their roles
  - Name of the Core Team liaison (if applicable)
  - Information on how to join the committee
- Create internal [documentation for operational procedures](https://github.com/carpentries/committees/blob/main/committee-charter-template.md#operational-procedures) (which may also be made public), including:
  - Process for recruiting and/or selecting new members
  - Process for on-boarding new members
  - Process for off-boarding members
  - Succession plan for chair/co-chair
  - Decision-making process
- Maintain internal and public-facing communication:
  - Organise committee meetings (at least twice a year) and post meeting notes in a consistent location (meeting notes should be public unless the work of the committee requires them to remain private)
  - Post meetings in the [community calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events). Note that meetings do not necessarily need to be open to public to attend even though they are added to the calendar - for example, the Code of Conduct Committee's business meetings are public, but incident response meetings are not.
  - Aim to host at least one community discussion per year to share about the committee's activities
  - Utilise other [The Carpentries community communication pathways](/resources/communications/index.md) to engage with the community as needed

Templates for creating committee documentation are available from the [*committees* repository](https://github.com/carpentries/committees). 

## Committee Termination
A committee may naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its goals, in which case the Core Team should be notified.
