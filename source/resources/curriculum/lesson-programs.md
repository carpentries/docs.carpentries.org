# Lesson Programs

The Carpentries supports and maintains Lesson Programs. Lesson Programs are collections of lessons comprising one or more Carpentries workshops, serving distinct goals and audience, and the leadership guiding their development and implementation.

From {{'[The Carpentries Bylaws]({}/about-us/governance/#carpentries-bylaws-and-policies)'.format(carpentries_website)}}:  
A Lesson Program within The Carpentries possesses the following characteristics:  
- Intention and purpose for lessons that align with The Carpentries mission and vision.
- Goals and objectives for lessons and/or workshops that are distinct from other Lesson Programs.
- Service to a particular audience of learners.
- Evidence of community member commitment to Lesson Program governance (see below), lesson maintenance, and curriculum development.

Adoption as an official The Carpentries Lesson Program is the last step of Lesson Program incubation as outlined in the [Lesson Program Incubation Roadmap](#lesson-program-incubation-roadmap).

## Lesson Program Incubation Roadmap

The Roadmap describes the three phases of a Carpentries Lesson Program: Pre-incubation, Incubation as a Lesson Project, and Adoption as a Lesson Program. Advancement from one phase to the next requires a proposal and approval process involving both Core Team and the Board of Directors. Approval of a new Lesson Program requires substantial investment from both the applicants and The Carpentries. In the case of the previous applicant for Lesson Program (Library Carpentry), the process was aided by a grant supporting a full-time Core Team member, and took about a year (though the community existed for several years prior). Details for each phase are described below.

### Phase 1: Pre-incubation

Pre-incubation is the initial phase of development of a Lesson Program during which a group of individuals come together to develop a new curriculum or Lesson Project to teach a specific set of skills to a targeted audience of learners. Groups that are developing Lesson Projects often come together organically for discussions regarding audience, need, learning objectives, and content. This phase is often quite long, possibly years.

Not all Lesson Projects will achieve the level of development or community commitment necessary for consideration for Incubation as a Lesson Program. Some groups may not consider this a goal and may prefer to consider the development of lessons within the Carpentries Labs or Carpentries Incubator programs as an alternative to becoming a full-fledged Lesson Program, as the latter requires significantly more overhead and commitment from their community. If the Lesson Project intends for their work to eventually lead to an application for Incubation as a Lesson Program, they should keep in mind that the goals and objectives of their lesson and/or workshops should be different from those of existing Lesson Programs and should have a distinct audience. If this is not the case, they may want to consider whether it is more appropriate to include the new lessons as options within the curriculum of an existing Lesson Program.

Outside funding or other external support may be required for the Lesson Project to develop their materials and community to the point where they would qualify for Incubation as a Lesson Program and to allow them to complete the steps required during the Incubation phase in order to gain full approval as a Carpentries Lesson Program.

During the Pre-incubation phase, activities by the Lesson Project will likely include most of the following:
- Development of a community interested in developing and teaching the lessons.
- Identification of a distinct audience that will be served by the lessons/workshops. If they intend to eventually apply for application as a Lesson Program, the target audience should not currently be served by another Carpentries Lesson Program.
- Statement of the goals of the Lesson Project, similar to a mission or vision statement.
- Definition of the scope of the lessons.
- Completion of draft versions of lesson content, including learning objectives.
- Early test runs of the lesson material at workshops with actual learners.
- Results from Carpentries short-term surveys if appropriate and possible.

**Application and Approval for Incubation Phase**

As the Lesson Project develops and undertakes the activities listed above in the Pre-incubation Phase, it may consider applying for Incubation as an official Carpentries Lesson Program. Application for Incubation requires the submission of a report from the Lesson Project that must include:
- Description of the community that is working on the Lesson Project.
- Description of domain knowledge required for instructors to teach the material, so that we can determine to what extent our existing Instructor pool may possess these skills and be able to teach these workshops.
- Description of the community that the Lesson Project serves with their workshops.
- Goals of the Lesson Project.
- List of the lessons developed or under development and what a two-day workshop would include, along with access to the materials for The Carpentries to review.
- Information about when and where at least some of the materials have been taught, even if as smaller modules and not yet a full-fledged 2-day workshop.
- Assessment information from the teaching events regarding number of attendees and learner feedback about the workshop(s), either using The Carpentries standard surveys or custom survey questions.
- How the Lesson Project feels that becoming an official Carpentries Lesson Program will benefit the Lesson Project, The Carpentries, and the broader learning community.

The Carpentries Board of Directors will then review these materials to determine whether the Lesson Project has met the core criteria for Incubation:
- Intention and purpose for lessons that align with The Carpentries mission, vision, and values.
- Goals and objectives for lessons and/or workshops that are distinct from other Lesson Programs.
- Service to a particular audience of learners.
- Evidence of Instructors with the relevant skills and knowledge to support the development of the program.
- Evidence of community member commitment to Lesson Program governance, lesson maintenance, and curriculum development.

The Board of Directors will decide on one of the options below:
- Approve the application and recommend the Lesson Project for the Incubation phase.
- Recommend revisions to the application or work that needs to be undertaken before the application can be approved or before it can be resubmitted for consideration, whichever the Board of Directors specifies.
- Reject the application for Incubation, providing reason(s) for rejection if appropriate.

### Phase 2: Incubation

Once approved for Incubation, the Lesson Project must accomplish specific requirements within a defined time frame (maximum 18 months) to be agreed upon between the Lesson Project and The Carpentries. 
The Carpentries will also have specific responsibilities toward the Lesson Project during this time (see Role of The Carpentries During Incubation).

During the Incubation phase, the Lesson Project will complete the following tasks:

#### 1. Policies and Processes
_Goal: to ensure compliance with existing Carpentries policies and processes._

1. Agree to abide by The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC).
1. Agree to have at least one trained instructor for each workshop.
1. Agree to The Carpentries workshop fee structure.
1. Define at least one curriculum that fits The Carpentries two-day workshop structure.
1. Agree for the Lesson Project to be included in Member Organisation agreements.

#### 2. Governance
_Goal: to ensure consistency with existing Lesson Program governance, and accountability for leading the work during Incubation._

1. Establish a culturally and linguistically diverse Lesson Program Committee (LPC) of at least three people to serve as a governance body and point of contact with The Carpentries.
1. The LPC should create a document describing this group’s roles and responsibilities.
1. The LPC should meet at least quarterly to oversee Lesson Project activities.
1. The LPC must demonstrate experience having discussions and making decisions by providing The Carpentries Core Team and Board of Directors with access to meeting minutes.

#### 3. Contributions
_Goal: to ensure a community of sufficient size and health exists to support the new Lesson Program after adoption._

1. Assign at least three Maintainers to maintain each of the lessons, without unreasonable overlap between the Maintainer teams of each lesson 
   (i.e. the same people maintaining multiple lessons).
1. Create an onboarding document and process for existing Carpentries Instructors so that they can determine whether or not they should consider teaching these lessons.
1. Create a plan to recruit additional Instructors for the program.
1. Create a plan to recruit new contributors to the program’s lessons.
1. Demonstrate community support for the lessons 
   (for example by providing metrics on GitHub activity, attendance at collaboration sessions, feedback from Instructors, or similar metrics).

#### 4. Teaching
_Goal: to ensure quality of curriculum, and demand for workshops._

1. Run pilot workshops to gather feedback on the curriculum and confirm that it is ready for teaching by the Instructor community.
1. Collect and analyse post-workshop feedback.
1. Complete and refine core curriculum, incorporating relevant workshop feedback.
1. Assign one or two leads for workshop coordination and communications work.
1. A list of workshops run during the Incubation Phase, or in the past year (whichever is the longer period of time).
1. A list of organisations which have expressed interest in hosting Centrally-Organised workshops using the Lesson Project’s curriculum.
1. A list of people who are able to teach the Lesson Project’s curriculum/curricula, whether or not they are already certified Carpentries Instructors.
1. Provide details of any special requirements for the Lesson Project’s workshops, for example resources or infrastructure that The Carpentries would need to provide for workshops to succeed.

#### 5. Supplementary Materials (optional but recommended):

- Letters of interest from organisations wanting to host workshops. 
  These letters of interest might indicate that the organisation 
    1. would be interested in requesting a centrally-organised workshop from the Lesson Program.
    1. would explore organisational membership to build their own capacity for teaching the Lesson Program's workshops.
    1. would host Self-Organised workshops for the Lesson Program.
- Summary of where funding support has been sought for this work, whether or not applications were successful.
- Summary of how personal time has been dedicated to this project 
  (i.e. how much has been volunteer hours and how much has been supported through employers) - 
  if supported by employers, what is the outlook for that support continuing?
- Summary of any infrastructure needs for supporting the Lesson Project’s workshops, along with a list of community members who are able to help fulfill any special requirements described in 4.8 above, and/or a plan for onboarding other community members to support it.

#### Role of The Carpentries During Incubation
During the Incubation phase, The Carpentries will:

- Allow access to pre- and post-workshop survey results through The Carpentries hosted infrastructure.
- Post information on The Carpentries website regarding the Incubation of the Lesson Project as well as through other communication channels and at Instructor Training workshops.
- Provide a Carpentries team member to meet with the Lesson Project for feedback or advice on a regular basis, with the frequency to be determined mutually by the Lesson Project and The Carpentries.
- Provide templates, workflows, and advice to support the Lesson Program in running pilot workshops, attracting new contributors, and other activities listed above.
- Assess how many current Core Team members would be able to teach the workshops of the new Lesson Program.
- Add Lesson Project community events to The Carpentries community calendar.


**Application and Approval for Official Lesson Program Adoption**

At the end of the agreed upon Incubation time period, or prior to that if the Lesson Project feels it has completed all the listed tasks, the Lesson Project's status will be reviewed by the Board of Directors. The Lesson Project should submit a request to The Carpentries documenting how it meets the criteria listed above. The Carpentries Board of Directors will review this application and evaluate whether the criteria have been met.

The Board of Directors will decide on one of the options below:
- Approve the application and adopt the Lesson Project as an official Carpentries Lesson Program
- Recommend revisions to the application or work that needs to be undertaken before the application can be approved, or before it can be resubmitted for consideration, whichever the Board of Directors specifies.
- Reject the application for Incubation, providing reasons for rejection if appropriate.

### Phase 3: Adoption

Once the Board of Directors has approved Adoption, the new Lesson Program will be listed as such on The Carpentries website and will be included as part of the standard workshop offerings. The Lesson Program should be committed at this point to maintaining their lesson materials and their community and to working with The Carpentries on long-term sustainability and the fulfillment of its roles and responsibilities in accordance with the Lesson Program Policy.

Once adopted, The Carpentries will update operations and documentation across the organisation to reflect the addition of the new Lesson Program. The Carpentries will also fulfill its roles and responsibilities in accordance with the [Lesson Program Policy](lesson-program-governance.md).
