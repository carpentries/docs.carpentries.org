# Curriculum Structure

The Carpentries contains multiple _Lesson Programs_ (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, Software Carpentry). Each _Lesson Program_ contains at least one _curriculum_. A curriculum is composed of one or more _lessons_.
Lessons are built from a series of _episodes_.

More detailed definitions of these terms are available in [the community glossary](https://github.com/carpentries/community-development/blob/main/glossary.md).
