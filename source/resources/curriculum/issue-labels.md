# GitHub Issue Labels
The Carpentries uses an extended set of issue labels. These labels can be applied to issues on a repository to aid categorisation and prioritisation and make it easier for visitors to the repository to more quickly understand the status of a given issue.
Maintainers are encouraged to make use of these labels and to add additional labels on their repositories if they will find them helpful.

## The Carpentries Issue Labels
The table below lists the labels used by The Carpentries in lesson repositories and their colour hex codes used on GitHub, and briefly describes the intended use/meaning of each label.
