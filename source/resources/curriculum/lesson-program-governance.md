# Lesson Program Governance Policy

Note that the [Trainers Leadership Committee](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md) will also follow this policy.

* Each Lesson Program will have a Lesson Program Governance Committee.
* Each Lesson Program Governance Committee will comply with the general [committee policy as described in the Carpentries Handbook](/resources/general/committees.md)
* In addition, each Lesson Program Governance Committee:
    * Maintains a minimum of 3 members to serve as on the committee and act as a point of contact with The Carpentries Executive Council and Core Team.
    * Follows all general policies as outlined by The Carpentries, including, but not limited to, the {{'[Code of Conduct]({})'.format(code_of_conduct)}}.
    * Determines the curriculum and core curriculum for (each of) the Lesson Program’s workshop(s), together with the corresponding [Curriculum Advisory Committee](/handbooks/curriculum_advisors.md) or by delegating curriculum decisions to the corresponding Curriculum Advisory Committee.
    * Decides if and when new lessons are added to or removed from the Lesson Program or delegate the decision of adding or removing a lesson to the corresponding Curriculum Advisory Committee.
    * Decides if one or more Curriculum Advisory Committees are needed for their curricula and how they are structured.
    * Decides how and how often they engage the Lesson Program community/communities.
    * Decides between:
        * seeking approval from the Executive Council to elect members to the Lesson Program Governance Committee.
        * appointing members based on an application process.
    * Decides committee members term lengths.
    * Decides on requesting additional Roles and Responsibilities beyond those described in this policy from the Executive Council.
    * Works with The Carpentries Core Team to maintain documentation (including the lesson program website) with information about its goals, workshops and curricula.

    * Decides if a Lesson Program Governance Committee’s policies do not align with the CoC or other Carpentries policies.
    * Decides whether to approve a Lesson Program Governance Committee’s request to elect committee members by its subcommunity, instead of being appointed through an application process.
