# Community Session Hosts Handbook

Hosting a community discussion is a great way to meet more people in The
Carpentries community, get to know the organisation better, learn from
the experiences of others and share your own knowledge and experience
with an even greater number of people.

Community discussions are also an integral part of our [Instructor
Training Certification
Process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/),
also known as ‘Checkout’. As a Community Discussion Host, you get to
welcome new Instructors into our global community and introduce them to
community discussions as an ongoing resource for support and advice as
they develop their teaching practices.

Topics covered during community discussions range from teaching
workshops and developing curricula to building local communities and
assessing the impact of our workshops globally. There are four types:

1. **Pre- and Post-Workshop Discussions:** These discussions are
   designed for those getting ready to teach or having recently taught
   to come to discuss their workshop with the community.
2. **Themed Community Discussions:** These discussions are centred
   around a particular topic ranging from teaching your first workshop
   to community-building strategies. Each month, the Community
   Development Team hosts **Welcome Sessions** for new community members
   to meet members of the Core Team and learn about ways to engage with
   the organisation.
3. **Carpentries Conversations:** These Conversations are hosted by one
   of our Committees or Task Forces to provide the community with the
   opportunity to learn about and discuss new developments and programs
   in our organisation.
4. **Regional Community Calls:** These calls are hosted by our local and
   regional subcommunities. A list of local and regional calls can be
   found at the top of the [Community Discussions
   Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions)

**Note.** Any of these four types of Community Discussions can be
attended to meet the requirement as part of [Instructor Training
Certification
(‘Checkout’)](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/)

## Roles and Responsibilities


A community member can serve as a community discussion host for any
length of time, considering their availability and interest. Specific
responsibilities include:

-  Attend one onboarding session, lasting one hour.
-  Sign-up to receive relevant communications for serving in this role.
   Instructions for signing up can be found in the [Communication and
   Collaboration Spaces section of this handbook]
-  During a quarterly scheduling period, schedule one or more community
   discussions on the date(s)/time(s) you want to host a discussion.
-  Facilitate one-hour community discussion sessions that you have
   signed up to host.
-  Make space for participation from anyone attending as part of
   ‘Checkout’. While participation is not a requirement for checkout, we
   want to make sure new community members feel welcome and get their
   questions answered. On the sign up list, these people will have
   included the word checkout next to their name.
-  Complete `a brief form <https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7>`__
   following each session you host. It is important that when you copy
   attendance into this form, you include the word ‘checkout’ next to
   the names where it appears in the sign-up on the Etherpad. The Core
   Team uses this information to record participation in  `AMY
   <amy_link_>`_, The
   Carpentries internal database. This is the primary way future
   Instructors get credit for completing this checkout step.

Onboarding
----------

If you are interested in becoming a community discussion host, you can
`email the Community Development
Team <mailto:community@carpentries.org>`__ to inform them of your
interest. They will provide you with the date and time of the next
onboarding session. Onboarding sessions are offered in multiple time
zones each quarter as a themed community discussion. `A
video <https://youtu.be/VrWdzlD2dlE>`__ and `accompanying
slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mal-KCfz5EaPuXXMCRiYxYsA41qPsWJfnj9ydMo9Y8Q/edit?usp=sharing>`__
that include the content covered in the onboarding are available as
references to support you as you serve in this role. Once you are
onboarded, you may want to first attend a community discussion as an
observer or co-host before leading a call as the host.

Offboarding
-----------

If you are no longer interested in serving as a Community Discussion
Host, please send an `email to the Community Development
Team <mailto:community@carpentries.org>`__. They will remove you from
the #discussion-host Slack channel and unsubscribe you from the
Discussion Host mailing list.

Step-by-Step Guides
-------------------

This section includes step-by-step guides to support you in your role as
a Community Discussion Host.

Signing Up to Host a Community Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that this guide is for signing up to host any community
discussion **except Regional Community Calls**. If you are a Community
Coordinator and wish to host a Regional Community Call, please follow
the instructions in the `Signing Up to Host a Regional Community Call
section <discussion_host.md#signing-up-to-host-a-regional-community-call>`__.
To learn more about becoming a Community Coordinator, please visit `the
FAQs section <#faq>`__.

-  Each quarter, communications will be shared from the Community
   Development Team via Slack and TopicBox with instructions to sign up
   to host a community discussion. Visit `the Communication and
   Collaboration Spaces section of this
   handbook <#communication-and-collaboration-spaces>`__ for
   instructions on joining one or both of these communication channels.

.. csv-table:: Schedule 
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20
   :file: ../_includes/calendar.csv
   :header-rows: 1

-  Community Discussion Hosts will sign up using
   `Calendly <https://calendly.com/thecarpentries>`__ during the signup
   period. Calendly allows you to select dates and times in your
   timezone for the sessions you plan to host. Dates and times already
   selected will not display.
-  Once hosts have scheduled themselves for a Community Discussion via
   Calendly, an automated workflow will add each event to the `Community
   Discussions
   Etherpad <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions>`__ and
   the `Community
   Calendar <https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events>`__.
   Another communication from the Community Development Team will inform
   hosts when the sessions have been added.
-  In the rare instance that you need to schedule a session outside of
   the quarterly scheduling period, the Community Discussion Host should
   complete the `Request to Schedule and Facilitate Carpentries
   Community Discussion
   form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen9_axxQ3_0FN5HjL7cyot9RzTdIGpOU16Wr1eatZblsfU7w/viewform>`__.
   The session is not confirmed until the host is contacted by a member
   of the Community Development Team.

Signing Up to Host a Regional Community Call
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Community Coordinators are responsible for scheduling and hosting
Regional Community Calls. These calls are currently listed, with their
date and time, at the top of the `Community Discussions
Etherpad <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions>`__ and
include a link to where the group records their call notes. If a
Community Coordinator is interested in listing a Regional Community Call
there and having it added to The Carpentries Community Calendar, they
should email community@carpentries.org. If they instead want to have the
call added to the Community Discussion Etherpad where individuals can
sign up to attend and collaboratively take notes, they can add the
events using `Calendly <https://calendly.com/thecarpentries>`__ during
the signup period as described in the `Signing Up to Host a Community
Discussion Session section of this
handbook <#signing-up-to-host-a-community-discussion>`__. This will
automatically add the event to the Community Calendar and to the
Etherpad. To learn more about becoming a Community Coordinator, please
visit `the FAQs section of this handbook <#faq>`__.

Checklist for Hosting a Community Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Community discussions use the `Community Discussions
Etherpad <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions>`__ where
community members can sign up to attend and collaboratively take notes
during the call. Many regional subcommunities use their own notetaking
platform for Regional Community Calls, and links to where they record
notes can be found at the top of the `Community Discussions
Etherpad <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions>`__ and are
also available in the `Community
Calendar <https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events>`__
listing.

Before the Discussion Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Sign on at least 5 minutes before the beginning of the discussion
   session.
-  It is recommended to create a waiting room. This enables the host to
   explicitly let people in, rather than allowing anyone to enter.

   -  `Learn about how to enable and use a waiting room as
      host. <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room#h_f493a86f-7d08-4e3b-9d6d-9b236fe9cdcd>`__

-  Gain host access.

   -  Two days before the event, the host will receive an automated
      email from Calendly that includes the host key.
   -  `Learn about how to use the host key to claim host
      access. <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001315866>`__

-  Enable closed captioning to improve accessibility of the event.

   -  Zoom provides automatic captioning of calls. Accuracy of
      captioning may be limited due to factors such as sound quality,
      accents, dialects, and jargon.
   -  `Learn about how to enable automatic
      captioning. <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Managing-Zoom-closed-captioning-and-live-transcription-services>`__

-  Confirm that the fellow host is present (if there is one) and who
   will be leading/taking notes.
-  If relevant, the host can copy the template agendas for all session
   types from the bottom of the `Community Discussion
   Etherpad <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions>`__ to
   the space under the sign up for the session. `Template
   agendas <#sample-agendas>`__ are also available in this handbook.

During the Discussion Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Use or adapt the `Script for Starting a Community
   Discussion <#script-for-starting-a-community-discussion>`__.
-  If relevant, follow the sample agendas provided at the bottom of the
   `Community Discussion
   Etherpad <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions>`__ and
   also available in the `resources section of this
   handbook <#resources>`__.

   -  We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but you can
      let the discussion go where people want. Not all the questions
      need to be answered by everyone.
   -  The host should not feel like they have to answer all the
      questions. They should draw on the other discussion participants
      to answer each other’s questions.
   -  If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt
      them to ask a question.
   -  Try to leave enough time in the end for Q&A and any announcements
      that need to be made.

-  Take notes or identify someone to take notes.
-  For pre-and post-workshop discussions: If there are more than 5
   workshops represented by attendees, we recommend splitting
   participants into two groups using breakout rooms to make sure
   everyone has enough time to share. When dividing attendees into two
   groups, try to balance the number of people who are de-briefing, who
   are there for pre-workshop help, and who are instructor trainees.
   `Learn more about how to set up and use breakout
   rooms <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#creating-breakout-rooms>`__.

After the Discussion Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Archive the Etherpad by selecting “Save Revision” (Note: displays as
   a star in the top right menu).
-  Fill out the `host form <https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7>`__.

   -  Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but
      removing no-shows) and paste it into the form. Be sure that anyone
      who attended for checkout has checkout written next to their name.
   -  When submitted, this form will automatically send an email to
      instructor.training@carpentries.org so all checkout requirements
      can be recorded.

-  Clear the information from the session (date/time, attendees, notes)
   from the Etherpad.
-  (Optional) `Write a blog
   post <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/guides/submit_blog_post.html>`__
   about interesting points that came up in discussion.

Cancelling a Discussion Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recognise that even after scheduling community discussions, the host
may have conflicts that arise that require cancelling a scheduled event.
If this happens, please contact community@carpentries.org as soon as
possible so a Core Team member can ensure another host is able to cover
the event. You can also post to one or more of the `Communication and
Collaboration Spaces <#communication-and-collaboration-spaces>`__ to
learn if another host is available to lead the call.

FAQ
---

**What if I am hosting a discussion and there are no pre/post workshop
debriefs?**

You could start by introducing the session and what it should be about.
You could also give some feedback on your own experience in previous
workshops and/or upcoming workshops that you are a part of.

**What if I do not know the answer to someone’s questions and no one in
the room does either?**

It is totally fine if you do not know all the answers. This is a great
time to demonstrate how someone in the community can get their questions
answered by posting the question to Slack or one of The Carpentries
mailing list. Questions can always be sent to team@carpentries.org and a
member of the Core Team will respond.

**What if the host/co-host has a poor internet connection and is unable
to communicate? What if Zoom fails to work (e.g. your internet
connection fails)?**

It is very important to test your internet connection beforehand and to
make sure that you as a host are able to communicate. The host is the
session leader and should have a stable connection. If, however, when
you test your connection, you find that you do not have a good
connection, contact the community via `our communication
channels <#communication-and-collaboration-spaces>`__ to find out if
someone could take over as host for the session.

**What if no one shows up?**

If no one shows up, send out a reminder email to participants who signed
up and wait for a few minutes. If now one shows up by :10 after the
start of the session, then fill in `the host
form <https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7>`__ and indicate that no one
showed up for your session.

**What if someone talks too much?**

Limit the amount of time that you give participants to ask and answer
questions. You could ask for feedback from someone who has not shared
yet to engage everyone in the conversation.

**What if there is no co-host/note taker and the session is fully
booked?**

As a host, you are more than welcome to take a few notes, however, there
is no need to take down every single thing that is shared. Note down
important points, making sure to add links to useful information.
Encourage participants to contribute to the notes on the Community
Discussions Etherpad.

**What if someone joins in late?**

Depending on how late the person joins, you could welcome them and ask
them to introduce themselves to the rest of the participants. If you
have time, you can ask the individual to stay on the call for a few
minutes after it is finished to summarise what they missed and answer
any questions they may have.

**What if someone does not have a headset and can’t control their
background noise?**

As a host, you will have the privilege to mute other participants, or
you could ask the person directly to mute their microphone. `Learn more
about how to use host features in
Zoom <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#information-for-event-hosts>`__.

**What if I forget to complete the host questionnaire?**

Participants will not have updated profiles that indicate completion of
this checkout requirement, and it will take a lot of administration to
solve this issue. Please remember to fill in the form directly after
hosting your session.

**What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct? What if someone had a
report of misconduct?**

In the case that this happens, `The Carpentries has a set of guidelines
that can be
followed <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html>`__.

**What if one person doesn’t contribute to the conversation?**

Try to encourage participation. This can be done by asking participants
a question or asking a person for their thoughts on a specific topic of
conversation. There is also a point in the agenda that allows you as the
host to talk to participants and ask them each for a specific question
that they need answering.

**What if someone asks to join my Community Discussion session to
complete their instructor checkout session and it is already full?**

Participants can email the host and ask to join the session even though
it is fully booked. It is up to your personal discretion as to whether
or not you accept additional participants.

**What if someone is loud/obnoxious and/or talks down to other people?**

It is very important to remind everyone of the Code of Conduct at the
beginning of each session as The Carpentries adheres to it during all
community events, including community discussions. Such behavior would
be a clear violation and you could ask the person to leave.

**What if I am having trouble understanding one of the attendees?**

You could ask the participant to type their questions in the Community
Discussions Etherpad for you to read and respond to them, which will
also make note-taking much easier. Consider asking them to speak up as
well if the microphone is too soft.

**What if I need to create a separate Etherpad for note-taking?**

Notes from all sessions can be taken on the Community Discussions
Etherpad and will be archived following each discussion. However, if you
think another Etherpad is needed for notetaking during your session, a
new Etherpad can be created by appending a descriptive name to the url
https://pad.carpentries.org/, such as
https://pad.carpentries.org/themed-discussion-15-09-2022.

**How can I become a Community Coordinator?**

A Community Coordinator is a member of the community who serves as the
leader of a subcommunity within The Carpentries. This role is being
formalized through the Community Development Program. If you are
interested in learning more, please email community@carpentries.org.
