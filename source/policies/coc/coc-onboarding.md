# CoCc Onboarding procedures for new members

Any voting member of the Carpentries community, as defined in The Carpentries bylaws, is eligible to express their interest to volunteer to sit on the [Code of Conduct Committee (CoCc)](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte/) (CoCc).
The Committee will invite new members every year  through open calls and from available volunteers. When a current member needs to step down quickly/urgently, the Onboarding team will open an extraordinary call for volunteers.

The [template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GtF4xbnfm0aopKZAUOaFhKJ1OB1SOj09PHBbxY55kk/edit?usp=sharing)) provides a set of questions used in the previous calls for application. These questions can be updated or changed by the Code of Conduct committee for subsequent calls as needed.

Application review is carried out by the onboarding team members, and applicants are selected based on their previous experience and motivation to support the work of CoCc in the future.
The onboarding team brings their decision to be discussed by the rest of the CoCc. The rest of the CoCc flags issues or concerns and confirms the selection when they agree with the initial decision.
New members are invited to sit in the CoCc as full members upon their onboarding as described below.
