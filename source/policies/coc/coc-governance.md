# Code of Conduct Committee Governance

## Membership

Any voting member of the Carpentries community, as defined in The Carpentries bylaws, is eligible to volunteer to sit on the [Code of Conduct Committee (CoCc)](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte/).

The Committee will onboard its members on a regular basis (for example, annually) through open calls and from available volunteers.
New members will undergo an application, selection and onboarding process before they are officially seated on the Committee.

The Executive Council (EC) will be notified about any new members. 
The EC has oversight of the governance of the Code of Conduct Committee but will have no influence over potential incidents and their resolutions.

## Onboarding

The onboarding process is determined by the Committee, and the EC will be kept informed about this process.
New members, including the Staff and EC Liaison, are not immediately seated on the Committee and thus not included in issue resolution until after onboarding is completed.

The current onboarding process is described in the [onboarding procedure document](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/coc-onboarding.html).
Additionally, incident response training will be organised for the new and existing members to ensure they can confidently serve on the committee.

## Administration

The Committee consists of a minimum of five members; approximately 10 is recommended.
The Committee, in addition, has a liaison from the Carpentries Core Team and a liaison from the EC.

The liaisons have the responsibility of informing the CoCc of anything that is relevant from their respective groups.
They are also responsible for conveying issues and updates to their respective groups from the CoCc that are relevant for them while respecting the confidentiality requirements of the Committee.

The Committee will have upto two chairs who will oversee the activities of the committee - these positions are taken for one year by the current CoCc members. The election is based on self-nomination and committee voting by CoC members who have already worked with the CoC committee for at least 6 months, and preferably through at least one report handling procedure. 

These individuals are responsible for holding regular business meetings and guiding the Committee’s work.

The committee members will select specific areas of CoC work and assume the roles of “area leads” after a committee vote/confirmation. Some areas of work identified by the current CoCc are: incident response, training, onboarding/offboarding and themed discussion.

Based on these areas of work, all area leads along with the Core Team and EC Liaisons will seek to improve the CoC policies and procedures. 

## Voting

The CoCc participates in two types of voting - votes about incidents and those not about incidents (e.g. business, policy, administrative matters).

### Non-incident voting

For non-incident-related matters, the Committee passes votes with a simple majority of the non-liaison members, with the chairs breaking any ties.
The Carpentries Staff(Core Team) and Executive Council (EC) liaisons can vote on matters such as election of chairs and area leads.
Members not attending can provide feedback and insights.
Quorum in meetings is more than 50% of the non-liaison CoCc members.

### Incident voting

For incident-related matters, any Incident Response Group (IRG) member will vote and the Chair will break any ties (refer [Incident Response Guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html)).

The Incident Response Lead of the [Incident Response Group](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/enforcement-guidelines.html#incident-response-assessment) will make this decision and indicate that the Incident Response Lead's vote will be necessary to resolve the incident as per the [guideline for responding](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html#checklists-for-responding-to-an-incident).

Should the Executive Council liaison participate in a CoCc vote, and that resolution is appealed before the Executive Council, the liaison member will abstain from that appeal vote.

## Terms of office

The expected term of office for each Committee member is a minimum one year, however, members may remain longer if they are able to offer their continued service or continuity of certain committee work is a concern.
During their time on the Committee, members may temporarily withdraw from Committee work for up to 3 months provided they inform the Governance Chair in writing.
If the members are unavailable for longer than 3 months, they will be asked to take a leave from the Committee.
They may volunteer to rejoin when they are available again following the onboarding procedure described earlier in the document.
This will allow us to maintain privacy for the reports handled in their absence and create an opportunity for new members to join the Committee.

The Chairs are expected to sit for a minimum of six months. Before stepping down, chairs will invite nominations and chair a meeting to elect a new chair. 
New Chairs are selected from among those who have been on the Committee for at least six months. One of the available members can volunteer to be elected to take on the role of a Chair.

## Main duties of the position holders

All members of the CoCc must read, understand and abide by the [membership agreement](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/coc-membership-agreement.html#).

## Communication and collaboration spaces

CoCc communication happens primarily in the #coc-discussion private channel of The Carpentries Slack workspace. Incident report discussions happen initially in the #coc-2023 private channel (as of 2023) and then move to separate, private documents shared among members of the Incidence Response Group for each case (reference [https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/enforcement-guidelines.html#incident-response-procedure-for-the-carpentries-code-of-conduct-committee]). The #coc-year channel is archived every year to avoid giving access to past discussions to new members. Members of the committee are expected to set their notifications to be alerted for all new messages posted to either channel.  

Members are not expected to be present on Slack perpetually, but should check the channels with some regularity. Subteam communications and other general discussions will happen in written form on Slack, and each member’s input is valued with asynchronous participation encouraged.

For incident responses, each member will provide a preferred way to receive urgent notifications.

The CoCc leverages a shared Google Folder to manage documents that are not on GitHub, such as meeting notes, a membership roster, and incident reports.
