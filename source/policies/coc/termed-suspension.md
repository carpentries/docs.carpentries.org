# Code of Conduct Termed Suspension Guidelines

## The Carpentries Termed Suspension Checklist

As a part of their enforcement options, The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC) committee can place a community member in Termed Suspension, where the community member is removed from all Carpentries engagement for a period of time.

The goal of a Termed Suspension is to 1) limit a person's participation in virtual and in-person Carpentries spaces for a set time to create a safe space for the community, and 2) to give time and opportunity for the individual to review their response to the incident and demonstrate immediate, ongoing, and demonstrable changes as evaluated by the CoC committee before possible reinstatement.

In most cases, a Termed Suspension will only be enacted after an incident has been reviewed by the CoC committee and a resolution is reached. However, in severe situations, in particular where there is active harassment, the CoC committee may enact an immediate short-term Termed Suspension while an incident is under review.

If there is a decision for a Termed Suspension, the following checklist is followed by the appropriate personnel to enact the Termed Suspension. In accordance with CoC confidentiality guidelines, only essential personnel will be involved in implementation of these actions.

## Member Organisation and Local Activities
The suspended member shall not be involved in officially branded Carpentries workshops or activities at the member or local site for the duration of the suspension. We expect the suspended member to assert that they will be able to carry out this suspension accordingly and to notify the CoC committee if this suspension will interfere with their expected employment duties. 

If the suspension does affect employment duties or the suspended member is the key contact for a member site, the member will work with The Carpentries Executive Director to determine a course of action.

## Executive Council
If the suspended member is a member of the Executive Council, they will not participate in Executive Council responsibilities and will be removed from the Executive Council repositories and list of Executive Council members on the website for the duration of their suspension.
