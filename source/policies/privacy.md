_Contributors:_
When preparing a lesson for release, we extract publicly-available information
about you (your GitHub handle, and the email address associated with your 
commits) from the commit history of the project. We do not otherwise actively
collect other personal information from lesson Contributors.

_Other Volunteers:_

**How is this information used?**

As a Maintainer or Contributor, we cross-reference your GitHub handle or name
against the community information stored in AMY to produce a `.zenodo.json` file
for the lesson, which lists the Maintainers (as Editors) and the other Contributors
(as Authors). This file includes your GitHub handle or name, depending on the
preference you have indicated in your {{"[AMY profile]({}#user-profiles)".format(amy_docs)}}, and your ORCID ID if you provided it. With your consent, this information may be used in scientific publications or to credit authorship.

Specifically as a Maintainer, we use your name on our websites, to list Maintainers
as a whole and for specific lessons. We also use your name to add you to the
maintainers Slack channel. We use your email address to contact you regarding surveys
to assign your status as active or inactive, invite you to meetings and other
calendar events, to contact you directly about lesson(s) you have maintained or
contributed to, and we use your GitHub handle to create or update GitHub teams
within our organisations, so that you can be tagged in issues/PRs as appropriate.

we list your name and committee membership on our website. We may use volunteer
information to contact you about additional opt-in opportunities for assessment, training,
teaching, volunteering and/or community engagement. We do not provide personally
identifiable information to any third party. However, we may share de-identified aggregate
or summary information regarding volunteers publicly or with other volunteers, member
sites or third parties, including but not limited to funding entities.

### Form and Survey Respondents

Community and workshop participants are invited to complete forms and questionnaires, and 
contribute to a variety of surveys to better serve our community. These include but are 
not limited to pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys of learners, and various opt-in 
surveys to evaluate programs or events.

**What information do we collect?**

Pre- and post-workshop surveys represent a formal part of the workshop training process and 
are vital to ensure that our lessons, organisation, Code of Conduct, and workshops adhere 
to our vision, mission, and standards. The information collected within these surveys is 
anonymised and used in reporting and impact studies.

Other opt-in surveys that you may be sent are entirely voluntary and information is
not collected in a way that it is linked to personally identifiable responses without
your consent to self-identify. Surveys collect information particular to the event
or program being evaluated, and any optional information about you.

**How is this information used?**

We use survey information to evaluate and improve our programs, report on impact
and outcomes, and understand the needs and interests of our community. With your
consent, we may use your contact details to request follow-up information from you.

### Organisational Services

Like many website operators, we may collect information that your browser
sends whenever you visit one of our websites. This Privacy Policy is applicable
to information that you provided/we collect through physical (such as a
paper form) and online means, including through our websites. We also use other
external online spaces, including but not limited to GitHub repositories, 
Etherpads, Google documents, Eventbrite and mailing lists. By using these
spaces, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Most of these
tools and services have their own independent privacy policies, to which 
you may agree separately.

**What information do we collect?**

We may collect information about visitors’ devices and browsers, such as browser
version and type, IP address, the pages of our sites that you visit, country of origin,
the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other
statistics, and whether you reached our page via a social media or email
campaign. You can control cookies in your browser to enable or disable them. 
Learn more in our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

If you access our Sites through third-parties (e.g., GitHub or Google), or if 
you share content from our Sites to a third-party social media service, the third
party service may send us certain information about you if the third party service
and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will 
depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.

In addition, we may collect textual input (e.g. Etherpad entries) from
you which may be associated with your name, affiliation and/or social media handles.
If you provide financial information to pay for a workshop or membership or make
a donation, the transaction information will be processed by a third-party 
secured site. This information will only be accessible to our staff or 
authorised administrators and to the staff of our fiscal sponsor 
([Community Initiatives](https://communityin.org/)) who is involved
in processing financial transactions. We engage with third-parties to gather 
and collect this information securely and do not have access to or store any
payment details in our systems.

**How is this information used?**

We use this information to improve our sites and services. With your consent,
we may use contact information that you provide to contact you about additional
opt-in opportunities for assessment, training, teaching, and/or community engagement.
We do not provide personally identifiable information to any third party. However,
we may share de-identified aggregate or summary information regarding visitors
publicly or with volunteers, partners or third parties, including but not limited
to funding entities. We may use publicly available data of the external online
services in programmatic analysis and evaluation.

## 2. How Do We Use Personal Information?

***We Never Sell Personal Information***: We will never sell, rent or otherwise

* To analyze Sites usage and improve the services offered
* For market research, project planning, and troubleshooting problems
* For detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity

We may process limited and specific elements of your personal information, e.g.
geographical location, into anonymised summarised statistics and infographics to 
produce publicly available reports and documents. We may also process pre- and 
post-workshop survey responses for inclusion into scientific publications. In these
cases, we will not disclose identifying personal information.

## 3. How Do We Share Personal Information?

### To the Public

With your consent, we may share your name, education, social media account handles,
and professional affiliation with the public for your role in our community and
other Core Team members’ biographies. The information you choose to provide to us 
will determine how much information is shared with the public. You can opt-in or 
opt-out of sharing your information publicly in your 
[AMY profile](https://carpentries.github.io/amy/users_guide/community_index/#user-profiles).
With your consent, that you can revoke at any time, we may also share testimonials or 
reviews, alongside your personal information.

### Carpentries Instructor applicants

If you have applied to be a Carpentries Instructor or are currently going through
the Instructor certification process, application information may be shared
with members of the Carpentries Core Team. We may also share your information in the 
following ways:
- If you have chosen "Pre-approved registration": your application
  materials and information about your progress towards The Carpentries Instructor
  certification may be shared with our contacts at your member institution.
- If you have chosen "Open training application": your application
  materials may be shared with The Carpentries Trainers in order to review and
  accept your application.

### Affiliates and Service Providers

We share your information with our third-party service providers and any
subcontractors as required to offer you our products and services. For example,
we use Mailchimp to send our email marketing campaigns, Help Scout for
communications, Square to process payments, and ConnectionPoint systems
and GitHub to collect program donations.

### Third Party Links and Websites

Our Sites may contain links to and from the websites of third parties. If
you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites
have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility
or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you
submit any data to these websites.

### Disclosures Requested by You

You may exercise your rights to request the personal data we hold on you under 
data protection law, and we are required to respond as quickly as possible within 
one calendar month, starting from the day we receive your request.

### Disclosures Required by Law

We may be required to disclose your data in response to lawful requests by
public authorities, including to meet law enforcement requirements. We may
be under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to
comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions
and other agreements, to protect our rights, property, or safety, or to
protect the rights, property, or safety of others. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud
protection.

### Aggregate and De-Identified Information

We reserve the right to share aggregate or de-identified information about you 
with our volunteers, workshop partners, and funding partners in order to analyse
and improve our programs, market our membership program, and apply for funding.
We use this information to help evaluate and improve programs, report on impact
and outcomes and understand the needs and interests of our community. Where we
share open-ended responses or testimonials, we always do so anonymously or ask
for explicit consent to allow de-identified responses.

## 4. How Do We Respond to ‘Do Not Track’ Signals?

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do
not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and
across websites or online services. When and where possible, we respect DNT
(e.g., page views on our Sites will not be recorded). However, we cannot
guarantee your DNT preference will be recognised across our Sites, as the
Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT
means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to
DNT.

## 5. Cookies

To make our Sites and services work properly, we sometimes place small data
files called cookies on your device. A cookie is a small text file that a
website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It
enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, or
other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering
them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. To
learn more, please see our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

## 6. Your Privacy Choices

As an organisation registered within the USA state of California, we abide by
the privacy rights stipulated below. However, we have staff and volunteers who
fall under other jurisdictions, so in all cases, we aim to comply with the GDPR
guidance, details of which can be found under the EEA sections below. For 
countries outside the UK, USA and EEA, we aim to comply with the processes
set out for international data transfer via Standard Contractual Clauses where
appropriate.

### Can I decide what communications to receive?

Yes. All communication with us is opt-in, except for when you need to receive
information about your program and for Instructors and Trainers, information
required to maintain your status. If you have consented to us contacting you,
you may occasionally be sent emails asking if you would like to opt-in to
communication channels that we feel may be of interest to you (for example,
a mailing list dedicated to your geographical area). In the absence of specific
action from you, we will assume you choose not to join these channels.

### Removing personal information

The data we collect is characterized by specific, explicit, and legitimate interest
to facilitate the continued functioning of The Carpentries organisation and its activities. 
As such, we retain specific data indefinitely that allows us to contact active 
volunteers, produce internal metrics and reports, and to publicly share anonymised impact 
studies and scientific publications.

Consent options regarding information held within the AMY database can be made by 
you from within AMY itself. For any other requests by you to revoke consent from us
holding any information on you outside the AMY database, please notify
privacy@carpentries.org. If you choose to exclude your information, we will delete
your personal information from our databases. However, this may interfere with our
ability to give you credit for training events you have completed or contributions
you have made to our lessons, to contact you about upcoming events in your area,
and may affect your active status within our organisation. Please contact us if
you have any questions about removal or archival of your data.

### Marketing Opt-Out

We may use your personal information to contact you with
newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may
be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving any, or all, of these
communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in any
email we send, or you can contact us using the contact details provided in the
“[Contact Information](#14-contact-information)” section below.

## 7. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA Individuals)

If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal bases for collecting and

  action on your requests. For example, the processing of your workshop request
  and administration fee, facilitating instructor training, and coordinating
  workshops.

  of our {{'[Code of Conduct]({})'.format(code_of_conduct)}}, maintaining the security of our
  network and services, direct marketing to you, and improvement of our
  services.

  requirements, which are subject to mandatory retention periods. We may also
  collect your Personal Information to record your requests to exercise your
  rights and to verify your identity for such requests.

  be withdrawn at any time.
* In some limited cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal
  Information from you, in response to investigation of breaches to our {{'[Code of Conduct]({})'.format(code_of_conduct)}} that involves violation of local laws, lawful
  requests by public authorities, including to meet law enforcement
  requirements, as described above in “[How Do We Share Personal
  Information?](#3-how-do-we-share-personal-information)”

You may contact us using the contact details provided in the “[Contact
Information](#14-contact-information)” section below for more information or to
exercise your rights.

## 9. International Transfers of Data

Given the international nature of our organisation, to be able to process your
personal data, it is necessary for us to transfer or share your personal data
outside the UK/EEA:

- with Core Team members within our organisation who are located outside the
  UK/EEA;
- with your and our service providers, (e.g., cloud service providers), who
  might have servers located outside the UK/EEA;
- if you are based outside the UK/EEA;
- where there is a European and/or international dimension to the services we
  are providing to you.

We will only transfer or share your personal data outside the UK/EEA:

- to a country, territory or organisation that has been assessed as providing an
  adequate level of protection for personal data ‘adequacy decision’ by the UK
  or the EU Commission;
- by using legally-approved UK or EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCS) or
  Model Clauses, in addition to implementing appropriate supplementary measures
  to ensure the protection of the personal data.

By accessing our Sites and using our Services, you acknowledge that your
personal data may be collected and transferred from your local jurisdiction
(including those in the European Economic Area and the UK) to the United
States or other jurisdictions.

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Sites are not directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not
knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become
aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us
using the contact details provided in the “[Contact Information](#14-contact-information)”
section below. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal
information, we will take immediate steps to delete such information and notify the

## 11. Change of Control

Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a
merger, reorganisation or other change in control.

## 12. How Do We Protect Personal Information?
    
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. For example, when possible, we use encryption to transfer and store
data. We further limit access to this data using access controls and
confidentiality commitments.

However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus,
while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable
procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal
information obtained through the Sites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
of any information you transmit to us.

## 13. Policy Changes

We may change our Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically
review this Privacy Policy to ensure you are familiar with the most current
version.
