# The Carpentries Cookie Policy


**Last updated:** 2022-01-15

To make our sites work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login or other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
 
We have put our cookies into the following categories to make it easier for you to understand why we need them:
 
1. **Strictly necessary:** These are used to help make our websites work
   efficiently, provide security features on our websites, and provide services
   that are required to provide the services you expect from our websites.
2. **Performance/analytics:** These are used to analyze the way our websites
   work and how we can improve it.
3. **Functionality:** These help to enhance your experience by remembering
   choices you have made concerning the features of the websites (e.g.,
   username, language, region you are in).
   
While we intend to limit third-party cookies, there might be pages on our websites that may set third party cookies. For instance, when we embed content from another site (e.g., a video), or when we use an external logging system (e.g., you log into {{"[AMY]({})".format(amy_link)}} using your GitHub credentials) they may set a cookie. We try to limit these situations, but cannot always control how these sites use cookies.

## Cookies and You
 
If you choose not to enable cookies, you will still be able to browse our
websites, but it will restrict some of the functionality of our websites or what
you can do.
