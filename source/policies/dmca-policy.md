# The Carpentries DMCA Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-02-01

We respect the copyright and other intellectual property rights of others and
expect users of our website and application (collectively, the "Services") to do
the same. In accordance with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(the "DMCA") and other applicable law, we have a policy of terminating, in
appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, users of the Service who
are deemed to be repeat infringers. We also may, in our sole discretion, limit
access to the Service and terminate the accounts of any users of the Service who
infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any
repeat infringement. See our Terms for more information.

## Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement

If you believe that content available on or through our Services infringes one
or more of your copyrights, please immediately notify our Copyright Agent by
mail, email or faxed notice (“Notification”) providing the information described
below, which Notification is pursuant to DMCA 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3). A copy of
your Notification will be sent to the person who posted or stored the material
addressed in the Notification. Please be advised that pursuant to federal law
you may be held liable for damages if you make material misrepresentations in a
Notification. Thus, if you are not sure that content located on or linked to by
our Website infringes your copyright, you should consider first contacting an
attorney.

**All Notifications should include the following:**

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of
  the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if
  multiple copyrighted works at a single online website are covered by a single
  notification, a representative list of such works at that website.
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the
  subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is
  to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate
  the material (e.g. the URL link of the material).
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining
  party, such as the name, account name, address, telephone number, and e-mail
  address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
* A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the
  material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
  its agent, or the law.
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under
  penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf
  of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Submit your notice to our designated DMCA agent by mail or email as set forth
below:

Please note that you may be liable for damages, including court costs and
attorney's fees, if you materially misrepresent that content on the Services is
copyright infringing.

Upon receiving a proper notification of alleged copyright infringement, we will
remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and promptly
notify the alleged infringer of your claim. We also will advise the alleged
infringer of the DMCA statutory counter-notification procedure described below
by which the alleged infringer may respond to your claim and request that we
restore this material.

Please note that our furnishing your claim to the alleged infringer will include
the personal information you provide in your notification, which the alleged
infringer may use to contact you directly. As such, by submitting a notification
of alleged copyright infringement, you consent to disclosure of your information
in the aforementioned manner.

## Counter Notification

If you believe your copyrighted material has been removed from the Services as a
result of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written
counter-notification letter to us. To be an effective counter-notification under
the DMCA, your letter must include substantially the following:

* Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the
  location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court
  in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United
  States, for any judicial district in which our Company is located.
* A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that filed
  the Notification or the party's agent.
* Your name, address and telephone number.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that
  the material in question was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
  misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
* Your physical or electronic signature.
* You may submit your Counter Notification to our Copyright Agent by mail, or
  email as set forth above.

If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the requirements
described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material after 10
business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we receive your
Counter Notification, unless our Copyright Agent first receives notice from the
party filing the original Notification informing us that such party has filed a
court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the
material in question. Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the
disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may
be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a false
Counter Notification constitutes perjury.
