# Community Session Hosts Handbook

## About This Handbook

The Community Discussion Host Handbook is designed to support members of The
Carpentries community who are serving as a Community Discussion Host. It is maintained by The Carpentries Community Engagement Team.  If you believe anything needs to be added or updated here, or if you would like to provide feedback on the content, please email the {{'[Community Engagement Team](mailto:{})'.format(community_email)}} or open an issue on the {{'[source repository of this handbook]({})'.format(gh_repo)}}. If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms used in this handbook, please refer to our {{'[Glossary of terms]({})'.format(glossary)}}.

## Introduction

Hosting a community discussion is a great way to meet more people in The
Carpentries community, get to know the organisation better, learn from
the experiences of others and share your knowledge and experience
with an even greater number of people.

Community discussions are also an integral part of our {{'[Instructor Training Certification Process]({}/checkout)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}},
also known as ‘Checkout’. As a Community Discussion Host, you get to
welcome new Instructors into our global community and introduce them to
community discussions as an ongoing resource for support and advice as
they develop their teaching practices.

Topics covered during community discussions range from teaching
workshops and developing curricula to building local communities and
assessing the impact of our workshops globally. There are four types:

1. **Community Sessions:** Our community discussion sessions are sessions on any topic relevant to the community that can be in any format. Each month, the Community Development Team hosts **Welcome Sessions** for new community members to meet members of the Core Team and learn about ways to engage with the organisation. 
1. **Regional Community Calls:** These calls are hosted by our local and  regional subcommunities. A list of local and regional calls can be   found at the top of the {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}}
1. **Skill- up Sessions:** A skill-up session offers a professional development opportunity for the community where relevant skills are taught.
1. **Collaboration Sessions:** Collaboration sessions dedicate time and space to co-develop a community resource or to co-work on any community activity. 


**Note.** Any of these four types of Community Discussions can be
attended to meet the requirement as part of {{'[Instructor Training Certification]({}/checkout)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}.

## Roles and Responsibilities

A community member can serve as a community discussion host for any
length of time, considering their availability and interest. Specific
responsibilities include:

-  Attend an onboarding session
-  Sign-up to receive relevant communications for serving in this role.
   Instructions for signing up can be found in the [Communication and
   Collaboration Spaces section of this handbook](#communication-and-collaboration-spaces)
-  During a quarterly scheduling period, schedule one or more community
   discussions on the date(s)/time(s) you want to host a discussion.
-  Facilitate one-hour community discussion sessions that you have
   signed up to host.
-  Make space for participation from anyone attending as part of
   ‘Checkout’. While participation is not a requirement for checkout, we
   want to make sure new community members feel welcome and get their
   questions answered. On the sign-up list, these people will have
   included the word checkout next to their name.
-  Complete [a brief form](https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7)
   following each session you host. It is important that when you copy
   attendance into this form, you include the word ‘checkout’ next to
   the names where it appears in the sign-up on the Etherpad. The Core
   Team uses this information to record participation in {{'[AMY]({})'.format(amy_link)}}, The 
   Carpentries internal database. This is the primary way future
   Instructors get credit for completing this checkout step.

## Onboarding

If you are interested in becoming a community session host it will take ~ 45 minutes of your time to get onboarded. 
Instructions are provided below:

Watch the onboarding video. [The video can be found on our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/gM-XXV07OtQ) and you can also view the accompanying [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HzvrQrUljqZRdyw85KviCg3txtMJb4V235wWGRhZrUU/edit?usp=sharing). Once you have watched the video or gone through the presentation, please [send an email](mailto:community@carpentries.org) with the subject “Community Session Host Onboarding” so we can record that you have been onboarded to the role.

## Offboarding

If you are no longer interested in serving as a Community Discussion
Host, please send an [email to the Community Development
Team](mailto:community@carpentries.org). They will remove you from
the #discussion-host Slack channel and unsubscribe you from the
Discussion Host mailing list.

## Communication and Collaboration Spaces

This section includes a list of communication channels and collaboration
spaces that support Community Discussion Hosts. Participants in these
spaces are expected to follow {{"[The Carpentries Code of Conduct]({})".format(code_of_conduct)}}. 
A description of the tools listed can be found in the {{'[community glossary]({})'.format(glossary)}}.

### Community Calendar

Once you have scheduled to host a call, a calendar invite will be sent
to the email address that you used when signing up. All community
discussions will also be listed on our {{'[Community Calendar]({}/community/events/)'.format(carpentries_website)}}.

### Etherpad


A list of Etherpads relevant to serving as a Community Discussion Host
include:

-  {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}}: This Etherpad contains a list of all upcoming community discussions where community members can sign up to attend and find login information for joining a session.
-  {{'[Pad-of-pads]({}/pad-of-pads)'.format(etherpad)}}: A list of The Carpentries' most commonly used Etherpads and other resources.

### Messaging and Communication

Slack is the software platform used by The Carpentries to support
synchronous and asynchronous communications. Channels support
communications, collaboration and co-creation among a subset of
community members, depending on the channel’s purpose. You can {{'[join The Carpentries Slack workspace]({})'.format(slack_invite)}}
to follow conversations on the channel relevant to this role:

-  #discussion-hosts: channel for Community Discussion Hosts and those
   interested in hosting community discussions

If Slack is new to you, our {{"[Slack Guide]({})".format(slack_guide)}} will help you to set up your profile and give you an overview of how we use the platform on a day-to-day basis.




### Mailing List

You can access The Carpentries mailing lists from
{{'[Topicbox]({}/latest)'.format(topicbox)}}.
{{'[The Discussion Host mailing list]({}/discussion-hosts)'.format(topicbox)}} is used for announcements relevant to Discussion Hosts.
To join one or more Carpentries mailing lists, you will need to {{'[create a login]({}/latest)'.format(topicbox)}}. Once
you have done this, you can scroll through the list of groups and click
“Join the Conversation” (for open mailing) or “Request to Join” (for
those mailing lists requiring administrator approval). If you are new to Topicbox, please check out our {{"[Topicbox Guide]({})".format(topicbox_guide)}}.

## Step-by-Step Guides

This section includes step-by-step guides to support you in your role as
a community discussion host.

-  Each quarter, communications will be shared from the Community    Engagement Team via Slack and TopicBox with instructions to sign up to host a community discussion. Visit the [Communication Resources section of this handbook](/resources/communications/index.md) for instructions on joining one or both of these communication channels.
-  Community discussion hosts will sign up using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) during the signup period. Calendly allows you to select dates and times in your timezone for the sessions you plan to host. Dates and times already selected will not display.

![Calendly signup animation](/images/calendly.gif)

-  Once hosts have scheduled themselves for a Community Discussion via
   Calendly, an automated workflow will add each event to the [Community
   Discussions
   Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) and
   the [Community
   Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/events/).
   Another communication from the Community Engagement Team will inform
   hosts when the sessions have been added.
-  In the rare instance that you need to schedule a session outside of
   the quarterly scheduling period, the community discussion host should
   complete the [Request to Schedule and Facilitate Carpentries
   Community Discussion
   form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen9_axxQ3_0FN5HjL7cyot9RzTdIGpOU16Wr1eatZblsfU7w/viewform).
   The session is not confirmed until the host is contacted by a member
   of the Community Engagement Team.

### Signing Up to Host a Regional Community Call

Subcommunity Coordinators are responsible for scheduling and hosting
Regional Community Calls. These calls are currently listed, with their
date and time, at the top of the {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}} and
include a link to where the group records their call notes. If a
Subcommunity Coordinator is interested in listing a Regional Community Call
there and having it added to The Carpentries Community Calendar, they
should email community@carpentries.org. If they instead want to have the
call added to the Community Discussion Etherpad where individuals can
sign up to attend and collaboratively take notes, they can add the
events using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) during
the signup period as described in the [Signing Up to Host a Community
Discussion Session section of this
handbook](#step-by-step-guides). This will
automatically add the event to the Community Calendar and the
Etherpad. To learn more about becoming a Community Coordinator, please
visit the [FAQs section of this handbook](#faq).

### Checklist for Hosting a Community Discussion

Community discussions use the {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}} where
community members can sign up to attend and collaboratively take notes
during the call. Many regional subcommunities use their notetaking
platform for Regional Community Calls, and links to where they record
notes can be found at the top of the {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}} and are
also available in the {{'[Community Calendar]({}/community/events/)'.format(carpentries_website)}} listing.

#### Before the Discussion Session


-  Sign on at least 5 minutes before the beginning of the discussion
   session.
-  It is recommended to create a waiting room. This enables the host to
   explicitly let people in, rather than allowing anyone to enter.

   -  [Learn about how to enable and use a waiting room as host.](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#using-a-waiting-room)

 -  Gain host access.
   -  Two days before the event, the host will receive an automated email from Calendly that includes the host key.
   -  [Learn about how to use the host key to claim host access.](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#gaining-host-access).
-  Enable closed captioning to improve accessibility of the event.
   -  Zoom provides automatic captioning of calls. Accuracy of       captioning may be limited due to factors such as sound quality,       accents, dialects, and jargon.
   -  [Learn about how to enable automatic captioning](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#closed-captioning).
-  Confirm that the fellow host is present (if there is one) and who
   will be leading/taking notes.
-  If relevant, the host can copy the template agendas for all session
   types from the bottom of the {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}} to
   the space under the sign up for the session. [Template
   agendas](#sample-agendas) are also available in this handbook.

#### During the Discussion Session

-  Use or adapt the Script for Starting a [Community
   Discussion](#script-for-starting-a-community-discussion).
-  If relevant, follow the sample agendas provided at the bottom of the
   {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}} and
   also available in the [resources section of this
   handbook](#resources).

   -  We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but you can
      let the discussion go where people want. Not all the questions
      need to be answered by everyone.
   -  The host should not feel like they have to answer all the
      questions. They should draw on the other discussion participants
      to answer each other’s questions.
   -  If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt
      them to ask a question.
   -  Try to leave enough time in the end for Q&A and any announcements
      that need to be made.

-  Take notes or identify someone to take notes.
-  For pre-and post-workshop discussions: If there are more than 5
   workshops represented by attendees, we recommend splitting
   participants into two groups using breakout rooms to make sure
   everyone has enough time to share. When dividing attendees into two
   groups, try to balance the number of people who are de-briefing, who
   are there for pre-workshop help, and who are instructor trainees.
   [Learn more about how to set up and use breakout rooms](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#creating-breakout-rooms).

#### After the Discussion Session

-  Archive the Etherpad by selecting “Save Revision” (Note: displays as
   a star in the top right menu).
-  Fill out the [host form](https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7).

   -  Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but
      removing no-shows) and paste it into the form. Be sure that anyone
      who attended checkout has checkout written next to their name.
   -  When submitted, this form will automatically send an email to
      instructor.training@carpentries.org so all checkout requirements
      can be recorded.

-  Clear the information from the session (date/time, attendees, notes)
   from the Etherpad.
-  (Optional) Write a blog post about interesting points that came up in the discussion.

#### Cancelling a Discussion Session

We recognise that even after scheduling community discussions, the host may have conflicts that arise that require cancelling a scheduled event. If this happens, please contact community@carpentries.org as soon as possible so a Core Team member can ensure another host can cover the event. You can also post to one or more of the [Communication Spaces](/resources/communications/index.md#communication-spaces) to learn if another host is available to lead the call.

## FAQ

**What if I am hosting a discussion and there are no pre/post-workshop
debriefs?**

You could start by introducing the session and what it should be about.
You could also give some feedback on your own experience in previous
workshops and/or upcoming workshops that you are a part of.

**What if I do not know the answer to someone’s questions and no one in
the room does either?**

It is fine if you do not know all the answers. This is a great
time to demonstrate how someone in the community can get their questions
answered by posting the question to Slack or one of The Carpentries
mailing list. Questions can always be sent to team@carpentries.org and a
member of the Core Team will respond.

**What if the host/co-host has a poor internet connection and is unable
to communicate? What if Zoom fails to work (e.g. your internet
connection fails)?**

It is very important to test your internet connection beforehand and to make sure that you as a host can communicate. The host is the session leader and should have a stable connection. If, however, when you test your connection, you find that you do not have a good connection, contact the community via [our communication channels](/resources/communications/index.md#communication-spaces) to find out if someone could take over as host for the session.

**What if no one shows up?**

If no one shows up, send out a reminder email to participants who signed up and wait for a few minutes. If no one shows up by 10 minutes after the start of the session, then fill in the (host form)[https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7] and indicate that no one showed up for your session.

**What if someone talks too much?**

Limit the amount of time that you give participants to ask and answer
questions. You could ask for feedback from someone who has not shared
yet to engage everyone in the conversation.

**What if there is no co-host/note taker and the session is fully
booked?**

As a host, you are more than welcome to take a few notes, however, there
is no need to take down every single thing that is shared. Note down
important points, making sure to add links to useful information.
Encourage participants to contribute to the notes on the Community
Discussions Etherpad.

**What if someone joins in late?**

Depending on how late the person joins, you could welcome them and ask
them to introduce themselves to the rest of the participants. If you
have time, you can ask the individual to stay on the call for a few
minutes after it is finished to summarise what they missed and answer
any questions they may have.

**What if someone does not have a headset and can’t control their
background noise?**

As a host, you will have the privilege to mute other participants, or
you could ask the person directly to mute their microphone. Learn more
about how to use [host features in Zoom](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md).

**What if I forget to complete the host questionnaire?**

Participants will not have updated profiles that indicate completion of
this checkout requirement, and it will take a lot of administration to
solve this issue. Please remember to fill in the form directly after
hosting your session.

**What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct? What if someone had a
report of misconduct?**

In the case that this happens, The Carpentries has a {{'[set of guidelines that can be followed]({})'.format(code_of_conduct)}}.

**What if one person doesn’t contribute to the conversation?**

Try to encourage participation. This can be done by asking participants
a question or asking a person for their thoughts on a specific topic of
conversation. There is also a point in the agenda that allows you as the
host to talk to participants and ask them each for a specific question
that they need answering.

**What if someone asks to join my Community Discussion session to
complete their instructor checkout session and it is already full?**

Participants can email the host and ask to join the session even though
it is fully booked. It is up to your personal discretion as to whether
or not you accept additional participants.

**What if someone is loud/obnoxious and/or talks down to other people?**

It is very important to remind everyone of the Code of Conduct at the
beginning of each session as The Carpentries adheres to it during all
community events, including community discussions. Such behavior would
be a clear violation and you could ask the person to leave.

**What if I am having trouble understanding one of the attendees?**

You could ask the participant to type their questions in the Community
Discussions Etherpad for you to read and respond to them, which will
also make note-taking much easier. Consider asking them to speak up as
well if the microphone is too soft.

**What if I need to create a separate Etherpad for note-taking?**

Notes from all sessions can be taken on the Community Discussions
Etherpad and will be archived following each discussion. However, if you
think another Etherpad is needed for notetaking during your session, a
new Etherpad can be created by appending a descriptive name to the URL
https://pad.carpentries.org/, such as
https://pad.carpentries.org/themed-discussion-15-09-2022.

**How can I become a Community Coordinator?**

A Subcommunity Coordinator is a member of the community who serves as the
leader of a subcommunity within The Carpentries. This role is being
formalised through the Community Development Program. If you are
interested in learning more, please email community@carpentries.org.
