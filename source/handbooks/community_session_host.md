# Community Session Hosts Handbook

## About This Handbook

The Community Session Host Handbook is designed to support members of The Carpentries community who are serving as Community Session Hosts. The Carpentries Community Engagement Team maintains it.  If you believe anything needs to be added or updated here, or if you would like to provide feedback on the content, please email the {{'[Community Engagement Team](mailto:{})'.format(community_email)}} or open an issue on the {{'[source repository of this handbook]({})'.format(gh_repo)}}. If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms used in this handbook, please refer to our {{'[Glossary of terms]({})'.format(glossary)}}.

## Introduction

Hosting a community session is a great way to meet more people in The Carpentries community, get to know the organisation better, learn from others' experiences, and share your knowledge and expertise with an even greater number of people.

Community sessions are also an integral part of our {{'[Instructor Training Certification Process ({}/checkout)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}, also known as ‘Checkout’. As a Community Session Host, you get to welcome new Instructors into our global community and introduce them to community sessions as an ongoing resource for support and advice as they develop their teaching practices.

Topics covered during community sessions range from teaching workshops and developing curricula to building local communities and
assessing the impact of our workshops globally. There are four types:

1. **Community Sessions:** Our community sessions are sessions on any topic relevant to the community that can be in any format. The Core Team also hosts various **Welcome Sessions** each month for new community members to meet Core Team members and learn how to engage with the organisation. 
1. **Regional Community Calls:** Our local and regional subcommunities host these calls. To view a list of local and regional communities and their activities, view our [Subcommunity Registry](https://carpentries.org/community/get-connected/#subcommunity-registry). 
1. **Skill-up Sessions:** A skill-up session offers a professional development opportunity for the community where relevant skills are taught.
1. **Collaboration Sessions:** Collaboration sessions dedicate time and space to co-develop a community resource or to co-work on any community activity. 

**Note.** Any of these four types of Community Sessions can be attended to meet the requirement as part of {{'[Instructor Training Certification]({}/checkout)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}.

## Roles and Responsibilities

A community member can serve as a Community Session Host. Specific responsibilities include:

-  Sign up to receive relevant communications for serving in this role.
   Instructions for signing up can be found in the [Communication and
   Collaboration Spaces section of this handbook](#communication-and-collaboration-spaces)
-  During a quarterly scheduling period, schedule one or more community
   sessions on the date(s)/time(s) you want to host a session.
-  Facilitate community sessions that you have
   signed up to host.
-  Check-in attendees to each session you host in Pretix. The Core
   Team uses this information to record participation in {{'[AMY]({})'.format(amy_link)}}, The 
   Carpentries internal database. This is the primary way future Instructors get credit for completing this checkout step.

## Onboarding

Please note that, from 1 January 2026, the onboarding process for Community Session Hosts will no longer be in use. Community sessions are open to anyone in the community to host, provided that sessions adhere to The Carpentries Code of Conduct. No formal onboarding is required.

## Offboarding

If you are no longer interested in hosting community sessions, please send an [email to the Community Engagement
Team](mailto:community@carpentries.org). They will remove you from the #discussion-host Slack channel and unsubscribe you from the
Session Host mailing list.

## Communication and Collaboration Spaces

This section lists communication channels and collaboration spaces that support Community Session Hosts. Participants in these
spaces are expected to follow {{"[The Carpentries Code of Conduct]({})".format(code_of_conduct)}}.  A description of the tools listed can be found in the {{'[community glossary]({})'.format(glossary)}}.

### Community Calendar

Once you have scheduled a call, a calendar invite will be sent to the email address you used when signing up. All community
sessions will also be listed on our {{'[Community Calendar]({}/community/events/)'.format(carpentries_website)}}.

### Etherpad

A list of Etherpads relevant to serving as a Community Session Host includes:

-  {{'[Community Session Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}}: This Etherpad contains a list of Etherpads available for Community Session Hosts to use. Instead of using the Etherpad as we have in the past, we will use Pretix for Community Sessions sign ups starting 1 January 2026 for [participant registrations](https://pretix.carpentries.org/community-events/).  
-  {{'[Pad-of-pads]({}/pad-of-pads)'.format(etherpad)}}: A list of The Carpentries' most commonly used Etherpads and other resources.

### Messaging and Communication

Slack is the software platform that The Carpentries uses to support synchronous and asynchronous communication. Channels support communications, collaboration and co-creation among a subset of community members, depending on the channel’s purpose. You can {{'[join The Carpentries Slack workspace]({})'.format(slack_invite)}} to follow conversations on the channel relevant to this role:

-  #discussion-hosts: channel for Community Session Hosts and those interested in hosting community sessions

If Slack is new to you, our {{"[Slack Guide]({})".format(slack_guide)}} will help you set up your profile and give you an overview of how we use the platform day to day.


### Mailing List

You can access The Carpentries mailing lists from
{{'[Topicbox]({}/latest)'.format(topicbox)}}.
{{'[The Discussion Host mailing list]({}/discussion-hosts)'.format(topicbox)}} is used for announcements relevant to Community Session Hosts.
To join one or more Carpentries mailing lists, you will need to {{'[create a login]({}/latest)'.format(topicbox)}}. Once
you have done this, you can scroll through the list of groups and click “Join the Conversation” (for open mailing) or “Request to Join” (for
those mailing lists requiring administrator approval). If you are new to Topicbox, please check out our {{"[Topicbox Guide]({})".format(topicbox_guide)}}.

## Step-by-Step Guides

This section includes step-by-step guides to support you in your role as a Community Session Host.

-  Each quarter, communications will be shared from the Community Engagement Team via Slack and TopicBox with instructions to sign up to host a community session. Visit the [Communication Resources section of this handbook](/resources/communications/index.md) for instructions on joining one or both of these communication channels.
-  Community Session Hosts will sign up using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) during the signup period. Calendly lets you select dates and times in your time zone for the sessions you plan to host. Dates and times already selected will not display.

![Calendly signup animation](/images/calendly.gif)

-  Once hosts have scheduled themselves for a Community Session via Calendly, a workflow will add each event to [Pretix](https://pretix.carpentries.org/community-events/) and the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/events/). 
-  In the rare instance that you need to schedule a session outside of the quarterly scheduling period, the Community Session Host should
reach out to the [Community Engagement Team](mailto:community@carpentries.com). The session is not confirmed until a Community Engagement Team member contacts the host.

#### Signing Up to Host a Local or Regional Community Call

Subcommunity Leaders are responsible for scheduling and hosting local and regional community calls. These calls are currently listed on the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/events/). If a Subcommunity Leader is interested in listing a Regional Community Call there and having it added to The Carpentries Community Calendar, they should email community@carpentries.org. If they instead want to have the call added to Pretix where individuals can sign up to attend, they can add the events using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) during the signup period as described in the [Signing Up to Host a Community Session section of this handbook](#step-by-step-guides). This will automatically add the event to the Community Calendar and Pretix. To learn more about becoming a Subcommunity Leader, please visit the [FAQs section of this handbook](#faq).

### Checklist for Hosting a Community Session

#### Using Pretix for Community Sessions

Starting in Q1 2026, The Carpentries will use Pretix for participants to sign up for Community Sessions. As part of The Carpentries commitment to a consolidated event-management system, we are moving registration into a secure platform to protect participant privacy, improve workflows such as time zone display and automated notifications, and strengthen our ability to track key data, including registration and no-show rates, enabling us to make more informed decisions about future work. Previously, Community Session Hosts completed a host form listing participants (and other information during the Community Session). From 1 January 2026, this will change. Community hosts will need to check-in participants via Pretix. Hosts will receive an email with instructions on setting up their Pretix account to check participants in. We recommend that Community Session Hosts log in at least 1-2 weeks before their session to troubleshoot if needed.  If you have not received this email one week before your Community Session, please email community@carpentries.org

The public link to sign up for community sessions is https://pretix.carpentries.org/community-events/community-sessions 


#### Before the Session

##### Changes to sign up process 

Instead of using the Etherpad as we have been, we will be using Pretix for Community Sessions from Q1 2026 for participant registrations (https://pretix.carpentries.org/community-events/).  Registered participants will get an email immediately after registering and a reminder two days before the session. Community Session Hosts will get Calendly notifications (this will not change). 

The [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-sessions-2026) will not list each event. Instead, it will just show standard/general information that applies to every session. Please make a copy and complete the information for your Community Session.

Please review the calendar and sign up here:  https://pretix.carpentries.org/community-events/community-sessions/

Agenda Template for Community Session Host (This will be updated before each session by the Community Session Host). 

#### Community Session Host to review registration

The Community Session Host can review registration for their session at any time. View registration here (must be signed in to Pretix): https://pretix.carpentries.org/control/event/community-events/community-sessions/checkinlists/   

##### Cancelling the session

You may also choose to cancel a discussion if no one has signed up a few days before the session. Please contact [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org) to inform them of the cancellation. They will update the community calendar and remove the session from Pretix.

If participants have signed up but Community Sessions hosts need to cancel, please contact [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org).

#### Pre-Session Setup and Responsibilities

-  Sign on at least 5 minutes before the beginning of the session.
-  It is recommended to create a waiting room. This enables the host to explicitly let people in, rather than allowing anyone to enter.
   -  [Learn about how to enable and use a waiting room as host](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#using-a-waiting-room)
 -  Gain host access.
   -  Two days before the event, the host will receive an automated email from Calendly that includes the host key.
   -  [Learn about how to use the host key to claim host access.](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#gaining-host-access).
-  Enable closed captioning to improve accessibility of the event.
   -  Zoom provides automatic captioning of calls. The accuracy of captioning may be limited by factors such as sound quality, accents, dialects, and jargon.
   -  [Learn about how to enable automatic captioning](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#closed-captioning).
-  Confirm that the fellow host is present (if there is one) and who will be leading/taking notes.
   

#### During the Session

-  Use or adapt the Script for Starting a [Community Session](#script-for-starting-a-community-session).
-  If relevant, follow the sample agendas provided at the bottom of the
   {'[Community Session Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}} and
   also available in the [resources section of this
   handbook](#resources).

   -  We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but you can
      let the session go where people want. Not all the questions
      need to be answered by everyone.
   -  The host should not feel like they have to answer all the
      questions. They should draw on the other session participants
      to answer each other’s questions.
   -  If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt
      them to ask a question.
   -  Try to leave enough time in the end for Q&A and any announcements
      that need to be made.

-  Take notes or identify someone to take notes.
-  For pre-and post-workshop sessions: If there are more than 5
   workshops represented by attendees, we recommend splitting
   participants into two groups using breakout rooms to make sure
   everyone has enough time to share. When dividing attendees into two
   groups, try to balance the number of people who are de-briefing, who
   are there for pre-workshop help, and who are instructor trainees.
   [Learn more about how to set up and use breakout rooms](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md#creating-breakout-rooms).

#### During/After the Session

-  If used, archive the Etherpad by selecting “Save Revision” (Note: displays as
   a star in the top right menu).
-  Clear the information from the session (date/time, attendees, notes)
   from the Etherpad.
-  (Optional) Write a blog post about interesting points that came up in the session.

The Community Session Host must record attendance by checking people in on Pretix. You can ask participants to list their attendance on the etherpad during the community session, then transfer this to Pretix. Please tell participants that if they have not signed up via Pretix yet, they should do so before the end of the session. Community Session Hosts will not be able to check them in if they do not do so. We recommend that you complete the check-in during a natural pause in the programme, such as a breakout discussion or a short networking break, to make sure it flows smoothly into the event. The Community Session Host will not need to complete a survey.  Participants will still need to complete a survey.

##### How to check-in participants to Pretix

1. Open the following link: https://pretix.carpentries.org/control/event/community-events/community-sessions/checkinlists/. Find the session you host and click on the name (i.e 2026-01-06T09:30:00Z)

## FAQ

**What if I am hosting a session and there are no pre/post-workshop
debriefs?**

You could start by introducing the session and what it should be about.
You could also give some feedback on your own experience in previous
workshops and/or upcoming workshops that you are a part of.

**What if I do not know the answer to someone’s questions and no one in
the room does either?**

It is fine if you do not know all the answers. This is a great
time to demonstrate how someone in the community can get their questions
answered by posting the question to Slack or one of The Carpentries
mailing list. Questions can always be sent to team@carpentries.org and a
member of the Core Team will respond.

**What if the host/co-host has a poor internet connection and is unable
to communicate? What if Zoom fails to work (e.g. your internet
connection fails)?**

It is very important to test your internet connection beforehand and to make sure that you as a host can communicate. The host is the session leader and should have a stable connection. If, however, when you test your connection, you find that you do not have a good connection, contact the community via [our communication channels](/resources/communications/index.md#communication-spaces) to find out if someone could take over as host for the session.

**What if no one shows up?**

If no one shows up, send out a reminder email to participants who signed up and wait for a few minutes. If no one shows up by 10 minutes after the start of the session, then fill in the (host form)[https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7] and indicate that no one showed up for your session.

**What if someone talks too much?**

Limit the amount of time that you give participants to ask and answer
questions. You could ask for feedback from someone who has not shared
yet to engage everyone in the conversation.

**What if there is no co-host/note taker and the session is fully
booked?**

As a host, you are more than welcome to take a few notes, however, there
is no need to take down every single thing that is shared. Note down
important points, making sure to add links to useful information.
Encourage participants to contribute to the notes on the Community
Session Etherpad.

**What if someone joins in late?**

Depending on how late the person joins, you could welcome them and ask
them to introduce themselves to the rest of the participants. If you
have time, you can ask the individual to stay on the call for a few
minutes after it is finished to summarise what they missed and answer
any questions they may have.

**What if someone does not have a headset and can’t control their
background noise?**

As a host, you will have the privilege to mute other participants, or
you could ask the person directly to mute their microphone. Learn more
about how to use [host features in Zoom](/resources/communications/zoom_rooms.md).

**What if I forget to complete the host questionnaire?**

Participants will not have updated profiles that indicate completion of
this checkout requirement, and it will take a lot of administration to
solve this issue. Please remember to fill in the form directly after
hosting your session.

**What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct? What if someone had a
report of misconduct?**

In the case that this happens, The Carpentries has a {{'[set of guidelines that can be followed]({})'.format(code_of_conduct)}}.

**What if one person doesn’t contribute to the conversation?**

Try to encourage participation. This can be done by asking participants
a question or asking a person for their thoughts on a specific topic of
conversation. There is also a point in the agenda that allows you as the
host to talk to participants and ask them each for a specific question
that they need answering.

**What if someone asks to join my Community Session to
complete their Instructor checkout session and it is already full?**

Participants can email the host and ask to join the session even though
it is fully booked. It is up to your personal discretion as to whether
or not you accept additional participants.

**What if someone is loud/obnoxious and/or talks down to other people?**

It is very important to remind everyone of the Code of Conduct at the
beginning of each session as The Carpentries adheres to it during all
community events, including community sessions. Such behaviour would
be a clear violation and you could ask the person to leave.

**What if I am having trouble understanding one of the attendees?**

You could ask the participant to type their questions in the Community
Session Etherpad for you to read and respond to them, which will
also make note-taking much easier. Consider asking them to speak up as
well if the microphone is too soft.

**What if I need to create a separate Etherpad for note-taking?**

Notes from all sessions can be taken on the Community Session
Etherpad and will be archived following each session. However, if you
think another Etherpad is needed for notetaking during your session, a
new Etherpad can be created by appending a descriptive name to the URL
https://pad.carpentries.org/, such as
https://pad.carpentries.org/themed-discussion-15-09-2022.

**How can I become a Subcommunity Leader?**

A Subcommunity Leader is a member of the community who serves as the
leader of a subcommunity within The Carpentries. This role is being
formalised through the Community Engagement Program. If you are
interested in learning more, please email community@carpentries.org.
