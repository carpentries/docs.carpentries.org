# Instructor Trainers Handbook

Instructor Trainers (‘Trainers’) are certified to co-teach Carpentries
Instructor Training events, the first step in certification for
Carpentries Instructors. Trainers also support 
{{'[Instructor certification]({}/checkout)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}},
also known as Checkout, evaluating trainees’ teaching demonstrations.

The Trainer community plays a leading role in The Carpentries, maintaining our flagship {{'[Instructor Training Curriculum]({})'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}, supporting policy development around training, and bringing Carpentries instructional practices to leadership roles across our local and global communities.

Trainers join a global community of skilled professionals with a passion
for evidence-based teaching and a shared goal of expanding access to
instructional training. Trainers build their own knowledge and skill
through co-instruction and monthly discussions, with additional
opportunities for in-depth exploration of relevant topics throughout the
year.

Trainers can assume leadership roles within the Trainer community, as
Instructor Training Curriculum Maintainers, or members of the Trainers
Leadership Committee.

Trainers often engage in leadership roles in their home communities,
mentoring local Instructors and modelling best practices. In most cases
Trainers do not self-organise private Instructor Training events for a
single local community, but these are allowed in certain circumstances.
More information on [Self-Organise a Private Instructor Training
Event](#self-organise-a-private-instructor-training-event).

## Roles and Responsibilities

Trainers teach Instructor Training events, host teaching demonstrations,
and attend Trainer community meetings. In order to remain active, we ask
that Trainers annually:

-  teach 1 Instructor Training event, and
-  host 2 teaching demos, and
-  attend 4 Trainer community meetings

OR

-  equivalent engagement with curriculum, trainees, or the Trainer
   community, as approved by the Trainers Leadership

The estimated time investment for these activities is 25-30 hours per
year, depending on preparation needs.

Trainers whose service is included in a member agreement may have
additional requirements – please refer to your member agreement for
details.

## Onboarding

### Trainer Training Program

#### Admission

The Trainer community periodically accepts new members via application.

-  Trainer Training is a **10-week program that is held 1-2 times per
   year** as needed.
-  All Trainer **candidates must apply and be approved** by a panel of
   current Instructor Trainers. We strongly recommend that candidates
   have either had

   -  **prior experience teaching Carpentries workshops** (with existing
      Instructor certification) or
   -  **significant prior training in teaching** (e.g. courses or a
      degree in education; experience teaching is also useful but is not
      the same as training)

-  Trainer Training seats are offered to approved applicants based on
   current organisational needs and training capacity. Space is limited,
   and qualified candidates may not be selected if we have low demand or
   multiple applicants in the same region.
-  Members can reserve Trainer Training seats for a fee. In these cases,
   while the seat is reserved for someone from the member institution,
   individual candidates must still apply and be approved.
-  The Carpentries keeps a list of interested applicants and member
   contacts who would like to be notified when the next round of Trainer
   Training applications open. To be added to this list, please email
   the [Instructor Training
   Team](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org)

#### Training and Initial Certification

In order to be certified as an Instructor Trainer, all trainees must:

-  Agree to abide by the [Code of
   Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
   in all communications and interactions with The Carpentries community
-  Attend weekly virtual seminar meetings

   -  Time commitment: 1 hour per week for 10 weeks; can miss up to 2
   -  Meeting times are determined by poll. Trainees may choose to wait
      for a future cohort if their scheduling needs cannot be met.

-  ReviewHow Learning Works by Susan Ambrose et al. and The Carpentries
   [Instructor Training Curriculum](https://preview.carpentries.org/instructor-training/)

   -  Time commitment: approximately 2-4 hours per week
   -  Actual time necessary for full benefit of preparation depends on
      prior familiarity with content and English language proficiency

-  Agree to participate as an Active Instructor Trainer for at least 1
   year.

Trainees who are previously certified as Carpentries Instructors must
additionally:

-  Observe a teaching demonstration session (1 hour)
-  Observe part of an online Instructor Training event (4 hours)

Trainees who are *not* previously certified as Carpentries Instructors
must concurrently pursue [Instructor
certification](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/), with all
steps completed or scheduled prior to badging.

**Total time estimate** for previously certified Instructors to become
certified Instructor Trainers: 35 hours (minimum) over a 3 month period.

For more information, see the {{'[Instructor Training Curriculum]({})'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}.

### Active Status Renewal Process


Version 1.0.1 – Approved 8 February, 2023

#### Active status for Instructor Trainers is renewed annually in March.

New Trainers who have not yet been certified for a full year and
Trainers who have returned to Active status within the past year will
automatically be renewed.

Active status may be renewed by either:

A) participating in curriculum and community activities during the prior
   year, as described below OR

B) meeting with the Director of Instructor Training (DIT) to catch up on
   curriculum and community changes and discuss plans for the coming
   year

Trainers who do not renew their Active status before the deadline will
have their status changed to Alumni. Instructions for Alumni returning
to Active status are detailed below.

In the case of option A, above, certification will be renewed
automatically when records indicate that Trainers have completed all
activities expected for Active Trainers, detailed below. If records are
incomplete, Trainers may self-report their activities via a form. The
Trainers Leadership Committee will review form responses and recommend
either renewal or a meeting (option B) based on reported activities.

Participation Expectations for Active Instructor Trainers

In order to be renewed based on prior participation, a Trainer is
expected to participate as follows during the 1 year period prior to
renewal:

teach at least 1 Instructor Training event, and

host at least 2 teaching demos, and

attend at least 4 Trainer community meetings

OR

equivalent engagement with curriculum, trainees, or the Trainer
community, as approved by the Trainers Leadership Committee

As a general rule, equivalent activities must be self-reported via form
submission. Trainers Leadership will provide guidance to help Trainers
choose what to share in the form, and when to select a meeting instead.

Trainer Alumni Status

Active Trainers may elect to become inactive by requesting Trainer
Alumni status at any time by contacting [Instructor
Training](mailto:instructor-training@carpentries.org). Alumni may
also submit re-activation requests to the same address.

#### Trainer Alumni will not be permitted to:


-  Teach Carpentries Instructor Training workshops

-  Host teaching demonstrations

-  Vote in Trainer community elections

Exceptions may be made at the discretion of The Carpentries Core Team.
To request permission to teach or host a demo, contact
team@carpentries.org.

#### Trainer Alumni may select to:

-  Continue to receive Topicbox Instructor Training emails & participate
   in conversations

-  Continue to participate in the Slack private Trainers channel

-  Receive an annual newsletter during agreement renewal with community
   updates and details on how to return to Active status.

-  A Trainer who wishes to return to Active status will have a different
   path depending on the amount of time they’ve been inactive:

-  0-12 months: meet with Director of Instructor Training to catch up on
   latest news & discuss plans for re-activating

-  More than 12 months: review Trainer Training curriculum, observe part
   of an Instructor Training workshop, and meet with Director of
   Instructor Training to catch up and discuss plans, including
   re-introduction to the Trainer community via meetings or other
   arrangements.

## Offboarding

### Trainer Alumni


Active Trainers may elect to become inactive at any time if they expect
to be unavailable to participate in the Trainer Roles and
Responsibilities for 1 year or more. Active Trainers may also have their

status](#active-status-renewal-process) during the annual renewal
period.

Trainer Alumni will not be permitted to:

-  Teach Carpentries Instructor Training workshops,
-  Host teaching demonstrations, or
-  Vote in Trainer community elections

Trainer Alumni may elect to:

### Meetings

Trainer meetings are scheduled at two time slots, twice monthly. Each
month includes a primary, “discussion” meeting, where Trainers are
invited to discuss upcoming trainings or events they have recently led,
and receive updates on recent developments from the community and Core
Team. The second time slot is used on an “as needed” basis, and may be
used for focused discussion on a specific topic or cancelled.

Meetings are open to Instructor Trainers, Trainer trainees, and invited
guests. Anyone else with interest in attending a Trainer meeting should
first contact the [Instructor Training 
Team](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).

Meeting notes are recorded in the [Trainers Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/trainers) and archived in the [Trainers repository on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/minutes).

## Step-by-Step Guides

### Quarterly Scheduling Calendar

Instructor Training events and Teaching Demonstrations are scheduled on
a quarterly basis. Refer to this schedule for planning and signing up to
support events, using instructions below.

.. csv-table:: Schedule 
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20
   :file: ../_includes/calendar.csv
   :header-rows: 1

### Training events

#### Sign up to Teach an Instructor Training Event

-  When signups open, Trainers will receive an email via Topicbox asking them to share their availability for the upcoming quarter in a Google form.
-  After the response deadline has passed, a Carpentries Core Team member will create a draft schedule and confirm events with individual Trainers.
-  We ask that Trainers keep available dates open until they have received confirmation of a training date or notification that they have not been scheduled for the quarter.
-  Once all events have been confirmed, the schedule is posted to the 
{{'[Instructor Training Calendar]({}/training_calendar)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}

In rare instances events may be cancelled due to low enrolment. If this happens, Trainers will be notified of potential cancellation two weeks before the event.

#### Cancel a Teaching Signup

Once events have been scheduled, any Trainer who needs to cancel will normally be replaced by another Trainer from the community or The Carpentries Core Team.

If you need to cancel after signing up to teach an Instructor Training event, email the [Instructor Training Team](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org). If your event is less than 2 weeks away, please include “urgent” in your subject line. For last minute emergencies (e.g. illness on the day of an event), additionally consider using Slack to the #trainers channel, tagging members of the [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/).

#### Teach Instructor Training


##### Preparation and Instruction

Guidelines on preparing to teach an Instructor Training Event can be found in the Trainer Notes section of the {{'[Instructor Training Curriculum]({}/instructor/instructor-notes.html)'.format(instructor_training_curriculum)}}.

##### Tracking Training Event Attendance

During an Instructor Training event, Trainers are asked to record attendance for all trainees [using a spreadsheet similar to this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RjiM8tL6CToMwGO2w7GAQwWHfYPb82RrQfuflF7hMjU/edit#gid=0). This spreadsheet will be created by the Core Team and shared with Trainers a week prior to their event. Attendance may be taken at the beginning of an event. In addition, Trainers are asked to observe continued attendance for all participants and annotate the attendance sheet if a trainee is absent for more than 1 hour on any day. Accurate records of time missed will allow the Core Team to determine appropriate makeup options for trainees who wish to complete checkout.

#### Self-Organise a Private Instructor Training Event

##### Requirements

In limited circumstances, Trainers may self-organise an Instructor
Training event for a specific group. This requires:

-  **2 or more Trainers** to teach
-  **Approved trainees**, either paid through membership or admitted as
   a sponsored group\*
-  **Advance notice**: find quarterly scheduling dates for events that
   use Carpentries infrastructure, or 30 days for fully independent
   events

To inquire about group sponsorship, contact the [Instructor Training
Team](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).

##### Use The Carpentries’ infrastructure

Self-organised trainings can choose whether or not to make use of
Carpentries infrastructure. This includes:

-  **Eventbrite registration**, using our event template. This template
   includes a prompt for trainees to fill out the Profile Creation Form
   in {{'[AMY]({})'.format(amy_link)}}, an essential step to tracking their progress through
   checkout. Trainers will have access to registration data and can make
   changes to the Eventbrite page as needed.
-  **Carpentries Zoom** room to use for virtual events

If you would like to make use of these, we ask that you provide notice
of your event prior to the quarterly scheduling deadlines.

**If you do not use The Carpentries’ Eventbrite template**, please
consider adding a prompt that directs registrants to complete our
{{'[profile creation form]({}/forms/request_training/)'.format(amy_link)}} in your
own registration system. This will ensure that we have the data we need
to certify your trainees.

##### How to Request a Self-Organised Instructor Training Event

If your event meets the requirements noted above, please use [this
google form to submit your request](https://forms.gle/WQGh5GVwhCBaY7xk6). For questions, {{'[email the Instructor Training Team](mailto:{})'.format(instructor_training_email)}}.

### Teaching Demonstrations

#### Sign up to Host a Demo

Signups for teaching demonstrations are normally announced with
Instructor Training event signups, but may be opened at other times if
there is a need for additional sessions.

-  When signups open, Trainers will receive an email via Topicbox asking them to sign up for teaching demos in the coming quarter via Calendly.
-  Calendly will automatically send an event confirmation email and calendar invitation.
-  After the response deadline has passed, a Carpentries Core Team member will create a list of events to post to the [Teaching Demonstrations Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos).

#### Prepare for a Demo


-  If you would like to review an example teaching demo, there is [a recording of one here](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/guide/index.html#vi-teaching-demonstration-tips).
-  Trainer-suggested scripts and other tips and tricks for hosting these    sessions are included in the [Instructor Notes](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/guide/index.html#vi-teaching-demonstration-tips) section of the Instructor Training Curriculum.
-  Get acquainted with using [Zoom](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html) for videoconferencing.
-  Check your Calendly confirmation email for the Host Key to use on Zoom, and keep this where you can find it. This will be necessary to allow trainees to screen share during your demo.
-  A day or two before the demo, send a reminder to trainees based on [this email template] (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/email_templates_trainers.html#reminder-teaching-demo).  This often prompts questions or cancellations. You may wish to use this [community-developed script](https://github.com/jcoliver/auto-demo-email) to generate your emails.
-  Select a suitable starting point in the lesson for each trainee. Suggested start points are available in the [Instructor Training Curriculum (under Extras)](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons/index.html).
   Do not have them start in the middle of an episode. Note that some lessons (e.g., the Software Carpentry R lesson using inflammation data) have supplementary episodes. Do not pick from those.
-  If a trainee has selected a lesson that is not on the list above, you may ask them to choose a different lesson or, if you are familiar with the lesson, you may choose a start point and allow them to use it anyway. Be sure the start point does not require any setup or rely on any dependencies from prior episodes.

#### Host a Demo

-  Go to the Zoom room. The link is in [the Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos).
-  Once everyone is in the call (with their audio and video working), remind them of the Code of Conduct, explain the procedure for the demo session, and remind them that trainees have to be able to teach from any episode from their chosen lesson. Ask whether anyone has only prepared for one episode, and if so, suggest strongly they reschedule.
-  Let trainees know that you will not tell them if they passed during the session, but instead will follow up with an email afterward. It can help to remind them that this is not a high stakes test but a friendly opportunity for feedback.
-  Ask those not presenting to give feedback using the same [positive-vs-negative and content-vs-presentation rubric](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html#giving-feedback) used in training. For a full session (5 trainees), they should add feedback to the Etherpad for you to summarise. If you have fewer people, you may have them take turns sharing verbally.
-  Give each trainee a few moments to get set up and initiate screen sharing before counting down to begin. Start a timer.
-  While they present, consider feedback, and take notes privately. Use this [rubric](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) as a guide, focusing on feedback that you think will be most necessary or helpful for the trainee as they progress toward   teaching.
-  After the timer ends, trainees should wrap up and share feedback on themselves first.
-  Summarise or share other trainees’ feedback as time allows, concluding with your own comments. It is sometimes necessary to (gently) disagree with feedback from another trainee.
-  Do NOT tell a trainee whether they passed immediately after their demo.
-  After everyone has gone, if all of trainees passed, it is ok to tell the group. Either way, tell the group you will email them afterward to follow up.
-  More tips can be found in the [instructor notes](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/guide/index.html#vi-teaching-demonstration-tips) of the instructor training website.

#### After a Demo: Report and Etherpad Cleanup

-  [Fill out this form](https://forms.gle/ZusNhyhNh4rvCmxH8) to notify The Carpentries of who passed and who did not pass.
-  Clear Etherpad of data from your session.
-  Send each trainee an email using our templates (#) letting them know
   they [passed](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/email_templates_trainers.html#trainee-did-pass-teaching-demo)
   or [did not pass](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/email_templates_trainers.html#trainee-didnt-pass-teaching-demo) the teaching demo. If needed, let them know the reason they did not pass and asking them to retry.

#### Cancel a Demo

**If no trainees have signed up:**

1. Remove the event from the [Etherpad](http://pad.carpentries.org/trainers). It is important
to do this first to prevent anyone from signing up! You have permission to remove your own demo and do not need to ask.
2. Notify [Instructor Training](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to let us know that your event needs to be removed from the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events).

**If trainees have signed up:**

1. If there is enough time, post a message in the #trainers Slack channel and/or send an email to trainers@lists.carpentries.org to find someone can take your place. (You may choose to skip this step, e.g. if there are only 1-2 people signed up.)

   1. If someone can take your place, make sure to confirm with them and have them add their information on the Etherpad.
   2. Make sure someone on the Core Team knows so they can be added to the calendar invitation. When in doubt, email [InstructorTraining](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).
   3. You are done!- Disregard steps 2+ below!

2. If step 1 is skipped or unsuccessful, email the trainees (#) to let them know that the demo has been cancelled, and ask them to sign up for a different session.
3. Remove the event from the [Etherpad](http://pad.carpentries.org/trainers).
4. Notify [Instructor Training](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to let us know that your event needs to be removed from the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events).

### Trainer Community

#### Share lessons learned from a Training event or Demo

Sharing after teaching or hosting a demo helps everyone to think about
their practice, learn from what you have learned, and consider ways we
can make our program better. To make the most of this opportunity,
consider sharing details about:

-  **What content you spent extra time on**. This tells people what you
   and your trainees considered to be most interesting, most important,
   or most challenging. Sometimes there are good things to explore
   behind those choices.
-  **What content you skipped**. This helps newer Trainers consider how
   to cut when they need to. It also helps Maintainers think about areas
   where future cuts or adjustments should be made in the curriculum.
-  **What choices you made to manage engagement**. Every group is
   different! Did you need to work harder to allow everyone to
   contribute? Mix up groups to break up some low energy combinations?
   Maybe you embraced your introverts and did more work in the Etherpad
   this time. Sharing choices you made in response to ‘reading the room’
   (or your feedback) helps others expand their choice options and
   discussion can inspire new ideas for handling tough problems.
-  **Subjective details.**\ “It went well” is great but hard to learn
   from. Why do you think particular things worked for your group? In
   what areas do you feel uncertain about your outcomes, and why? There
   are no right or wrong answers to questions like this, but your
   opinions tell a story that helps others reflect and understand their
   own practice.

Don’t remember? You’ll be surprised how much you can refresh in 5
minutes! A quick review of your Etherpad, notes, etc. really helps to
get ideas flowing before the meeting.

#### Propose a Meeting Topic

If you’d like to connect with others from the community on a particular
topic, you do not need to wait for someone else to host a meeting!
Propose a topic and invite others to join you. Core Team members are
always available to host or co-host.

To suggest a meeting topic, Go to the [new issues page in the Trainers
repository](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/new/choose)
and select the Get started button for “Template for Trainer Meeting
Topics”. Fill in the form, including a title for the Issue (which can be
the same as the title of the proposed Trainer meeting topic). Before
proposing a topic, we suggest you view topics that have already been
proposed or scheduled at the [Trainers meeting scheduling
page](https://github.com/orgs/carpentries/projects/4/views/2). You
may wish to specify whether you think a short discussion (during a
standard meeting after pre/post workshop conversations) or a dedicated
meeting would be more appropriate.

Example discussion topics (always worthy of a repeat by request!):

-  Working on your teaching practice
-  Teaching about the Code of Conduct
-  Supporting trainees in a local community
-  Teaching demo hosting practices

#### (Co-)Host a Trainer Meeting


To host a meeting, review the meetings that are already scheduled
(“Upcoming Meetings” tab) and those that have yet to be scheduled
(“Proposed” tab) at the [Trainers meeting scheduling
page](https://github.com/orgs/carpentries/projects/4/views/2). If you
find a topic you would be interested in hosting, (1) select the title of
the meeting you are interested in (in the “Upcoming Meetings” or
“Proposed” tabs) for more information about the proposed topic; then (2)
scroll down to leave a comment in the dialog box below the proposal to
indicate if you would like to host or co-host and which meeting(s) you
can attend.

The [trainer meeting pad](https://pad.carpentries.org/trainers) has information on the meetings or the [meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/minutes) for information about past meetings.

If you sign up to host a meeting by yourself, a Core Team Trainer will be your co-host. Hosting duties can be split in any way, but a common example is:

Host:

-  Prepares agenda for discussion (Note: template for pre/post
   discussion and announcements will be prepared by Core Team)
-  Selects and leads a warmup activity
-  Facilitates meeting (including pre/post discussion if scheduled that
   day)

Co-host:

-  Claims “host” role in Zoom, enables waiting room if desired
-  Takes notes
-  Assumes host role if host loses connection

#### Reminder Teaching Demo


Note: There are instructions under “Preparing for a Demo”

Subject: The Carpentries teaching demonstration

Hi,

According to the Teaching Demo Etherpad you have signed up to give an
online teaching demo on [ date ] at [ time ] (Local time: [
timeanddate.com link ]). I will be the Trainer teaching the session.

I wanted to be sure you know that I may give you any segment of the
lesson you prepared to teach, so you must be ready to teach any part of
your chosen lesson. Some people prepare to teach only 5 minutes from a
particular section and they often have to reschedule as they seldom are
assigned the section they have prepared for.

A lesson corresponds to a single line in the lesson tables
(https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ ,
http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ , and
https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) and a single repository on
GitHub. Some lessons have supplementary modules, but you do not need to
be prepared to teach the supplementary modules for your teaching
demonstration.

For example, if you have chosen The Unix Shell, I may assign you any
episode listed at http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/.

Please remember – this is not a high stakes test! This is a friendly
opportunity to give and receive feedback on a more polished presentation
style. In the event that I ask you to repeat your demo, I will provide
this information with clear instructions on what to change in an email
to you after the demo. You will only receive qualitative feedback
publicly during the demo, not information regarding whether this
checkout step is considered complete.
