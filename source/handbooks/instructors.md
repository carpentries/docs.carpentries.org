# Instructors Handbook

## About This Handbook

The Instructor Handbook is designed to support members of The
Carpentries community who are serving as an Instructor. It is maintained by The Carpentries Workshops and Instruction Team.  If you believe anything needs to be added or updated here, or if you would like to provide feedback on the content, please email the {{'[Workshops and Instruction Team](mailto:{})'.format(workshops_email)}} or open an issue on the {{'[source repository of this handbook]({})'.format(gh_repo)}}. If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms used in this handbook, please refer to our {{'[Glossary of terms]({})'.format(glossary)}}.

## Introduction

Carpentries Instructors are volunteers who are certified through the
Carpentries Instructor Training program to teach live-coding and data
skills to learners through evidence based-teaching practices.

## Roles and Responsibilities

-   Organise and facilitate Self-Organised Workshops
-   Volunteer to facilitate Centrally-Organised Workshops

Time Expectation: Flexible.

Instructors can decide when they would like to plan a Self-Organised
Workshop or support a Centrally-Organised Workshop.

For a **Self-Organised Workshop** Instructors should expect to dedicate
the duration of the workshop which is approximately 16 hours, in
addition to at least five hours to organise a workshop.

For a **Centrally-Organised Workshop** Instructors should expect to
dedicate the duration of the workshop which is approximately 16 hours,
in addition to approximately one to three hours of pre-planning meetings.

## Onboarding

Steps to becoming an Instructor.

1.  **Attend an Instructor Training event** The training runs over two
    full days or four half days and covers the basics of educational
    psychology, evidence-based classroom practices, and how to apply
    both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries. For more details,
    visit the [Instructor training curriculum
    page](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
2.  **Complete the checkout process** You must complete three short
    tasks after the training to complete certification as a
    Carpentries Instructor. See our [Checkout
    Instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html)
    page for more details.

### Instructor Training Attendance Policy

#### No Shows

A ‘No Show’ is when a trainee does not cancel or contact the [Instructor Training Team](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) before an event, and does not attend training. In a 'No Show' event, the training seat will be considered used.

If extenuating circumstances have prevented a trainee from cancelling, contacting, or attending an event, they may request permission to register for an additional event using the same registration code by emailing instructor.training@carpentries.org. IMPORTANT: **Requests to re-register <span style="text-decoration:underline;">must</span> be received within 7 days after the end date of the training. **

Trainees with multiple unexplained no-shows may be barred from future registration.


#### Partial Absence 

Trainees who miss up to 4 hours (1 half day) of an event can schedule a 45-minute 1:1 makeup meeting to complete their training with The Carpentries Director of Workshops and Training. [Makeup meetings can be scheduled via Calendly.](https://calendly.com/sheraaron/instructor-training-makeup). To prepare for a makeup meeting, trainees should review all sections of the Instructor Training Curriculum they missed and come prepared to share thoughts and questions about those sections. Trainees who missed more than 4 hours of an event **should not** schedule a makeup meeting. (See Re-taking a Training Event, below.)

Trainees are not eligible for Instructor certification until their record indicates they have completed an entire Instructor Training event.


#### Re-taking a Training Event 

Trainees who miss more than 4 hours (1 half day) of an event are not eligible for a makeup meeting but can ask to attend another event in full. To request permission to register for an additional training event, trainees should email [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) within 30 days of a missed event. 

When re-taking a training, trainees who miss more than 2 hours may be marked absent, even when they have attended part of a prior event. Multiple partial trainings may not be used to complete the training requirement. 


#### Ineligibility for Makeup Opportunities

Trainees who miss an event in full without cancelling within 7 days (no-show) or who miss part of an event but do not request a makeup opportunity within 7 days are ineligible to register for a new training event using the same registration code. Trainees interested in completing training may contact [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to be advised on their options for re-admission.


### Checkout Extensions Policy

Trainees are asked to complete checkout within 90 days of attending an Instructor Training event. Having a deadline is necessary to support busy people in prioritising a goal we all care about. However, it is sometimes necessary for trainees to postpone completing checkout. 

Trainees who are unable to complete checkout within the 90-day deadline should contact us at [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to request an extension. Extensions may be granted up to one year after the checkout deadline.  After one year, you may contact instructor.training@carpentries.org to explore opportunities to re-take the training.

## Step-by-Step Guides

### Planning & Organising a workshop

1.  Decide on the order of the lessons and who will teach which modules
2.  Set up the workshop website using the Carpentries template and send it
    to the Workshops and Instruction Team by submitting a [Self-Organised workshop form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/). Detailed
    instructions are in the
    README of the [workshop website template repo](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template).
    *Note: If you are teaching a Centrally-Organised workshop, you will share the website directly with the Workshops and Instruction Team through email*
4.  Create a collaborative document for the workshop (e.g. an Etherpad)
5.  Assist the host in recruiting helpers if possible
6.  Assist the host in ensuring the workshop location is accessible
7.  Share emergency contact information with the host in case of last-minute
    changes
8.  Practice teaching the material
9.  Remind the host of the necessary equipment
10.  Join a community discussion
11. Confirm criteria for reimbursement (per diem or save receipts)

documentation](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/instructor_tips.html)

### Software Installation

Installing software on laptops has been made easier over the years,
but it can still be a huge challenge at the start of a workshop. Below
are suggestions for ensuring the process goes as smoothly as possible.

**What you can do in advance:**

-   Plan for installation help at the start of both workshop days. Put
    it on the schedule and make sure it is clear that people can and
    should show up during that time.
-   Email the participants a week in advance and the day before to
    remind them to install the needed software before the workshops.
-   If possible, recruit helpers who use Linux, Mac, and Windows
    operating systems.
-   If you/helpers/instructors have time, test the install instructions
    on a fresh user account on your computer.
-   If you anticipate issues (or want to be extra prepared), have some
    of the emergency options listed below ready to go.
-   If you are teaching for an organisation where participants are
    bringing work laptops and they do not have administrative access
    (common in government organisations) -- ask about it. Try to plan
    ahead either with their central IT organisation or with the
    "emergency exits" listed below.
-   Will you have decent Wi-Fi? Many people installing software at
    once can hinder a poor internet connection. If this is the case, prep
    a few flash drives with the relevant installers.
-   Attend a [Community
    Discussion](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions),
    where you can talk to other Instructors to ask questions and get
    feedback to help you prepare to teach.

**On the day of:**

-   Refer to our [Wiki page for solutions to common
    problems](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions)
-   If someone has come in early and the software still cannot be
    installed by the time the workshop starts, try one of the "emergency
    exits" below or keep working with them one-on-one until they are
    able to start.
-   If someone comes in late or is having such trouble with an installation
    that they cannot start, have them watch (and maybe work with a
    neighbour) until the first break, when you can work
    on installation issues together.

**"Emergency Exits"**

If there is no way that you will be able to install the
software locally on someone's computer, consider using the [following
solutions](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/workshop-coordination.md#supporting-learners-with-carpentries-scaffolds):

Find solutions on our blog post, [Scaffolding Installation for Online
Workshops](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/scaffolds/)

-   Pre-configured "scaffolds" for [RStudio
    Cloud](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/workshop-coordination.md#rstudio-cloud)
    and [My
    Binder](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/workshop-coordination.md#my-binder)
    (hosting Jupyter and OpenRefine).
-   [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/) gives you a cloud
    based Jupyter notebook with many languages and platforms installed.
    It also includes a shell terminal with git.
-   If your institution's library does laptop rentals, rent one to two laptops
    and set them up with the software before the workshop and keep them
    on hand as loaners during the workshop.

### About the Code of Conduct

The [Carpentries Code of
Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
is a key tool for fostering and upholding an inclusive, respectful
learning environment. But for people who are new to the idea of a Code
of Conduct, it can be a little awkward to talk about. Here is a sample
of how you might introduce the Code of Conduct -- please do not use this
verbatim, but adapt it to your own audience and style of introduction:

The Carpentries is a community-led project. We value the involvement of
everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and
respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All
participants in our events and communications are expected to show
respect and courtesy to others.

What kinds of behaviours are expected?

All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either
online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional
learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in
all Carpentries events and platforms:

-   Use welcoming and inclusive language
-   Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism
-   Focus on what is best for the community
-   Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any Carpentries
event/platform can be found in the [Code of
Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#reporting-guidelines).
We Instructors take the Code of Conduct very seriously, and we have a
process for dealing with violations and complaints. Read the [Reporting
Guidelines
section](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#reporting-guidelines)
for the details on how to handle Code of Conduct violations.

### Using Exercises

When teaching a lesson, it is a very good idea to go through the lesson
in advance and choose which exercises you want participants to try.

Once you have selected exercises, there are several ways to
display them to the participants during the workshop. Choose from the
options below, depending on the tool you are using or
the exercise you selected.

-   From the lesson website (zoomed in)
    -   This is the least effort, but requires having the right lesson
        page open + finding the right exercise
-   Make slides
    -   More effort, but easy to flip forward to the next one
-   Have a document of some kind with all the exercises in it
    -   More effort, but exercises are all in one place.
-   Put exercises in the Etherpad
    -   If you do this in advance, pretty low-effort.
    -   Can also use this with any of the other strategies so people can
        find the exercise in two places.
-   Online tool, like [Socrative](https://www.socrative.com/)
    -   Requires time to set up, but is great for multiple choice and
        T/F questions and promotes participation

In all of the examples, you will have to switch from the tool you are
using for live coding to however you are showing the exercises. For
something like R or Python, one way to reduce the amount of switching is
to put all the exercises in an R script / Python notebook and have that
open alongside your main working script/notebook so that it is
relatively easy to switch back and forth.

### General Tips

**Introductions**

The introduction is one of the most important pieces of the workshop! It
sets the tone for the day. The [instructor training
material](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/23-introductions/index.html)
has some suggestions of how to build a good workshop introduction.

**Accessibility Check-In**

[The Carpentries Toolkit of IDEAS \|
Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7041935#.Y4on_svMJD_)

Before you start, review our [accessibility
checklist](https://carpentries.org/files/pdf/accessibility-checklist-virtual-events.pdf).

**Varying Skill Level**

Carpentries workshops frequently include many people with widely varying
skills and experiences. The end of The Carpentries Instructor Training
on [Carpentries teaching
practices](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/24-practices/index.html)
has some strategies when working with a diverse classroom.

## FAQ

[List of frequently asked
questions](https://carpentries.org/workshop_faq/) relevant to the
content in the handbook.

### Pre-workshop

-   **Why isn't my workshop listed on
    the**[carpentries.org](http://carpentries.org)**webpage?**
    -   There are three things that must happen in order for a workshop to
        appear on The Carpentries webpage. You must complete the
        {{'[Workshop Request Form]({}/forms/workshop/)'.format(amy_link)}}, the workshop website
        must include the venue, and at least one instructor must be
        identified. If the instructors change, we will get notified and
        will be able to make the update.
-   **If I am teaching a Data Carpentry Genomics workshop, how many AWS
    Instances will be provided and when will we receive the AWS
    Instances?**
    -   A member of the Workshop Administration Team will contact the
        hosts/instructors approximately two to three weeks prior to the workshop
        to find out how many instances are needed. You will be asked to
        provide the total number of instructors, helpers and learners.
        Approximately 1 week, prior to the workshop, the Workshop
        Administration Team will provide you with test instances for
        each instructor and helper for testing/practice. Approximately 3
        days before the workshop, you will be asked for your final
        attendance so we can send you the AWS instances for the
        workshop. On the day prior to the workshop, the Workshop
        Administration Team will provide you with instances for each
        instructor, helper and attendee for the workshop. We will also
        send a few extras for backup. The AWS Instances will be
        terminated the day after the workshop. The AWS Instances will be
        terminated the day after the workshop. Please submit your
        workshop request/notification form at least 21 days in advance.
-   **What is a slug? And how should I use it to name my workshop
    website?**
    -   A slug is a unique identifier used by The Carpentries to connect
        a workshop with an organisation. Each workshop will have its own
        slug. The slug should use the following format
        YEAR-MM-DD-SITE-(online)
    -   YEAR being replaced by the four-digit year (2020)
    -   MM being replaced by the two-digit month (03)
    -   DD being replaced by the two digits representing the first day
        of the workshop (23)
    -   SITE being replaced by the organisation or location name
        (stanford)
    -   If the workshop will take place online, please add online
        (online)
    -   This slug format is a part of a validation check in our system,
        including the dashes separating these variables.
-   **Does the instructor need to be listed as the contact person on the
    workshop webpage or a member of the host institution?**
    -   The contact person for the workshop webpage can be designated by
        the workshop organiser. The person listed should be able to
        answer questions regarding the workshop, ie attendance policy,
        waitlist, location, installation, etc. You can have multiple
        persons listed as the contact person if needed. \*It is optional
        for a member of the host organisation to be listed on the
        workshop webpage.
-   **Where do I find the pre/post survey for the learners to use?**
    -   The learner facing survey links are automatically generated on
        the workshop's webpage. Generally, they will be located directly
        above and within the schedule. You are welcome to share the
        survey links (located on the workshop webpage) with your
        attendees whenever the time is right for your workshop.
-   **How do I access the survey results?**
    -   If you are planning a workshop please notify the Workshop
        Administration Team of your planned workshop using the [workshop
        request form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/). The
        Workshop Administration Team will send the link to view results
        of the survey one to two weeks prior to the workshop. If there are more
        than 10 survey responses, you will have the option to download
        the survey data, using the 'Download CSV' link at the bottom
        right of the survey results page.
-   **Who can be a Helper and what do they contribute to the workshop?**
    -   [Helpers](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#helper-checklist)
        are often recruited from the local community at the host site to
        support Carpentries workshops. Helpers support learners
        one-on-one if they are stuck installing software, understanding
        a certain line of code, or any other parts of the learning
        process.
-   **How do I sign up to teach a Centrally-Organised Workshop?**
    -   In order to sign-up to teach a Centrally-Organised Workshop you
        must login to `AMY`{.interpreted-text role="term"} using your
        GitHub credentials. The [handbook has
        instructions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/for_instructors/current_instructors.html#teaching)
        on how to sign-up.

### Curricula

-   **If I am only teaching portions of the Carpentries curricula, do I
    still need to register my workshop?**
    -   It is important that we know about workshops being publicised
        because people often contact us to report that they will be
        unable to attend a workshop or to ask questions and if we do not
        know about planned workshops we can not provide support or share
        information with instructors.
    -   If you are teaching only a portion of The Carpentries curricula or
        if the workshop does not align with the [Core
        Curriculum](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core) of a lesson program, we
        ask that you still {{'[register]({}/forms/workshop/)'.format(amy_link)}} your self-organised workshop and
        select the "Mix & Match" option for the question "Which
        Carpentries workshop are you teaching?". **This option is only
        available for Self-Organised workshops. Centrally-organised
        workshops are required to follow the Core Curricula.**
-   **When a workshop is taught, how closely should it stick to the
    Carpentries lesson plans?**
    -   To be considered an official Carpentries workshop, you must
        follow the [Core
        Curriculum](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core) of a lesson program.
        If you teach something other than what is listed on our webpage
        we ask that you acknowledge that your workshop is "inspired by
        SWC/DC/LC" or "based on SWC/DC/LC". You can still
        [register](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/)
        your workshop and select the workshop you are teaching is "Mix &
        Match", so that we can show others how you use The Carpentries
        resources.
-   **When will I be considered an Experienced Instructor?**
    -   Ater being an Instructor for three Carpentries workshops you
        will be able to take the role of Experienced Instructor in any
        Carpentries workshop.

### Centrally-Organised

-   **Are Instructors paid a stipend?**
    -   The instructors selected to teach workshops are volunteers and
        are not paid for their service. To compensate for their time we
        require the Host to cover travel expenses. If you would like to
        support the instructors, you are encouraged to make a targeted
        [donation](https://carpentries.org/donate/) to support
        instructor development
-   **As an instructor, will I still get credit for a workshop if the
    host canceled?**
    -   If you are scheduled to teach a Carpentries workshop and the
        host cancels, you will still receive credit for the workshop. If
        a workshop is scheduled and you have to resign from teaching,
        you will not receive credit for the workshop.
-   **Will I be notified if a workshop is canceled or postponed?**
    -   A Workshop Administrator will notify Instructors as soon as a
        workshop has been canceled or postponed by the Host. Confirmed
        Instructors for the original workshop dates will be given
        priority selection when the new dates are confirmed.

#### Online workshop

-   **Will I be provided with a Zoom room to teach my online workshop?**
    -   If your institution has a videoconferencing platform available,
        we recommend that you use that same platform for The Carpentries
        workshop. This will reduce the time needed for workshop
        organisers and learners to learn a new system. However, if you
        do not have access to a video conferencing system, we will be
        able to provide you with access to one of our Zoom rooms.
-   **I have never taught an online workshop, where should I begin?**
    -   All Instructors should be familiar with the [Recommendation for
        Teaching Carpentries Workshops
        Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/)).
        This will give you the foundation for online Carpentries styled
        workshops.
-   **How do I indicate my workshop will be online in the workshop
    website template?**
    -   We updated the [workshop website
        template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) to
        make it easier to indicate that a workshop will be taught
        online.
-   **How many instructors are needed to teach an online workshop?**
    -   Teaching online is a challenge. We recommend a minimum of two
        instructors and a maximum of four instructors with the
        assistance of helpers. Please review the recommended
        [instruction
        roles](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#instructional-roles)
        for a workshop.
-   **How do I sign-up to teach a Centrally-Organised Workshops?**
    -   In order to sign-up to teach a Centrally-Organised Workshop you
        must login to AMY using your GitHub credentials. The [handbook
        has
        instructions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/for_instructors/current_instructors.html#teaching)
        on how to sign-up.

#### In-person workshop

-   **Do Instructors pay for travel?**
    -   As a volunteer Instructor who is not paid for their time
        teaching, we ask the host to cover travel and accommodation
        costs. We recommend that the host budgets approximately \$1000
        per Instructor for all travel expenses.
-   **What if I am no longer comfortable teaching an in-person workshop
    after the travel has been purchased?**
    -   We encourage the purchase of insurance where possible. This will
        help ensure that most funds will be recouped in the event of
        cancellation. In the event an Instructor is being reimbursed for
        expenses and cancels, the host will not be held responsible for
        insurance.
    -   We would ask that the Instructor teaches virtually if they are
        no longer comfortable teaching in-person. Learners will
        participate either fully online or fully in-person
-   **What if the in-person event policy changes before the workshop
    takes place?**
    -   We understand that policies change regularly and sometimes
        unexpectedly. We ask that the host provide any changes
        immediately to all involved parties so that the coordination can
        align with those changes.
-   **What are The Carpentries' in-person event procedures for in-person
    workshops?**
    -   We will follow the in-person event guidelines of the host
        institution. This will differ between organisations and we will
        ensure that all parties involved are aware of any policies that
        are in place.

### General

-   **How do I get survey data/links for previous workshops?**
    -   The Workshop Administration Team can provide survey result links
        for past workshops (August 2018 - present) to workshop
        instructors/organizers or instructors affiliated with the
        hosting organisation. To request survey results links, please
        send an email to the [Workshop Administration
        Team](mailto:workshops@carpentries.org) with your request and
        include a link to the workshop website(s) and/or slug(s).
-   **How many times a year do I have to teach to be eligible to vote?**
    -   Instructors are required to teach at least one time per year to
        be eligible for voting. Please find our
        [Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#individual-voting-membership)
        for more information.
-   **What happens if I need to make changes to my workshop website?**
    -   Please feel free to make changes to your website. You do not
        need to let us know, these changes are updated manually each
        week. However, if you change your workshop repo name (or link),
        please do let us know as we will not be able to pull information
        from your website without updating the link in our database.
