## Introduction 

Lesson Program Governors are members of **Lesson Program Governance Committees (LPGCs)**, groups of community members that oversee and guide the strategy and health of The Carpentries Lesson Programs.

The responsibilities of Lesson Program Governance Committees fall into three main categories of leadership: strategy, advocacy, and communication.
* Strategy:
  * Monitoring the health of the lesson program and designing strategies to maintain and improve it
  * Identifying priorities for growing the community and reach of the lesson program
* Advocacy:
  * Representing the lesson program in their local and professional networks
  * Working with the Executive Council and Core Team to promote the interests of the lesson program within The Carpentries
* Communication:
  * Reporting on the activities, objectives, and needs of the lesson program to the Executive Council and Core Team
  * Engaging the community on topics and projects relevant to the development of the lesson program
  * Maintaining up-to-date information about the lesson program on The Carpentries' websites

A Lesson Program Governance Committee will typically have 3-5 members, including at least one member acting in each of the two Officer roles, Chair and Secretary.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Chair
* Prepare agenda for regular meetings, including time estimates for each item.
* Set the agenda and send it out along with any other relevant documents to committee members at least one week in advance of the meeting.
* Assign meeting roles.
* Serve as the primary point of contact for the Executive Council, Core Team members, and Curriculum Advisors for the relevant lesson program.
* Prepare a written update, twice per year, for the Executive Council, summarising the committee’s activities, main points and outcomes of discussion, and any major decisions made.
* Communicate with the lesson program community and the Core Team, through GitHub issues, blog posts, or another appropriate platform, about decisions made by the LPGC.
* Coordinate with Curriculum Team Lead (Toby Hodges) to request information and support from the Core Team to help the LPGC perform its functions, e.g. data and information relating to the health of the lesson program, or delegate responsibility for this to another committee member.
* Notify the Curriculum Team Lead if an LPGC member needs to step down mid-term or becomes unresponsive to communications so that the Core Team can help recruit a replacement if needed.
* Approve meeting minutes.
* Fulfil all other responsibilities of an LPGC member.

### Secretary
* Schedule regular meetings.
* Arrange meeting room logistics.
* Send calendar invites.
* Send meeting reminders.
* Prepare meeting minutes and post them to the appropriate LPGC GitHub repository.
* Fulfil all other responsibilities of an LPGC member.

### Other members
* Notify the Chair of potential agenda items as they arise.
* Review the agenda and other relevant documents sent by the Chair before the meeting.
* Attend and actively participate in regular meetings by being attentive, and sharing knowledge, expertise, ideas, and information.
* Participate in asynchronous voting through GitHub as needed.
* Work with community members and the Core Team to implement voted-upon changes as needed.
* (Optional) Be involved in discussions relevant to the LPGC on GitHub and elsewhere.

## Onboarding
_Details of frequency and format of future Lesson Program Governor selections coming soon..._

* Rounds of recruitment will be announced on The Carpentries blog.
* Onboarding aims to provide new Lesson Program Governors with context for the role of how LPGCs fit into The Carpentries model for community governance, and what they can expect as they prepare to join their first committee meeting.
* The first onboarding for Lesson Program Governors took place in three parts:
  * A general onboarding for all Lesson Program Governors
  * An optional but recommended session on _How to Run a Meeting_, led by Greg Wilson
  * An additional onboarding for the committee officers (Roles and responsibilities above)
* Onboardings are delivered by the Curriculum Team over Zoom, with the possibility of being onboarded through a recording of the sessions available for those who cannot attend synchronously.
  * Links to onboarding slides are provided in [the Resources section](#resources).
* After these onboarding sessions, Lesson Program Governors should complete the following steps:
  * [Log into AMY](https://amy.carpentries.org/) with GitHub credentials and update their profile.
  * When updating their AMY profile, it is essential that Governors give consent for The Carpentries to publish their profile so that they can be listed on The Carpentries websites.
  * Join the mailing list for their committee on [The Carpentries TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups).
* Subscribe to notifications from the GitHub repository for their committee
  * Repositories for each committee are listed in [the Communication and Collaboration Spaces section](#communication-and-collaboration-spaces).

### Term Length
Term lengths for Lesson Program Governors are defined in the charter document of each committee. The committee charter can be found in the committee’s GitHub repository.

## Offboarding
Offboarding is necessary when a Lesson Program Governor’s term ends or if they choose to step away from the role for any other reason. If a Governor wishes to leave their role outside the standard term limit, they should [notify the Curriculum Team](mailto:curriculum@carpentries.org).

Lesson Program Governor offboarding includes the following steps, which will be coordinated by the Curriculum Team:

* Reassigning any open issues on the committee repository to another committee member
* Revoking their access to the GitHub repository
* Removing them from the TopicBox group for the committee
* Removing them from the LPGC listing on the lesson program and Carpentries websites
* Inviting feedback from the departing member on their experience as an LPGC member

## Communication and Collaboration Spaces

### Etherpad
Below is a list of Etherpads relevant to serving as a Lesson Program Governor. 

*  {{'[Pad-of-pads]({}/pad-of-pads)'.format(etherpad)}}: A list of The Carpentries' most commonly used Etherpads and other resources.
* {{'[Community Discussions Etherpad]({}/community-discussions)'.format(etherpad)}}: an etherpad for signing up to upcoming discussion events. If the LPGC schedules any discussions e.g. to consult with the lesson program community on a topic, these events will be listed here.

### GitHub
The following LPGC repositories exist on GitHub, for collecting meeting minutes, managing discussion issues, etc:

* Data Carpentry: <https://github.com/datacarpentry/governance>
* Library Carpentry: <https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/governance>
* Software Carpentry: <https://github.com/swcarpentry/governance>

### Slack

{{'[Join The Carpentries Slack workspace]({})'.format(slack_invite)}}. Although decision-making should be done in meetings and/or publicly visible communication channels, LPGCs may also wish to create a private channel on this Slack workspace for day-to-day discussions, meeting planning, etc.
If you are new to Slack, please check out our [Slack Quick Start Guide](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html#slack-quick-start-guide).

### TopicBox
You can access The Carpentries mailing lists from
{{'[Topicbox]({}/latest)'.format(topicbox)}}. Each LPGC has a dedicated mailing list on TopicBox:

* {{'[Data Carpentry]({}/dc-governors)'.format(topicbox)}}
* {{'[Library Carpentry]({}/lc-governors)'.format(topicbox)}}
* {{'[Software Carpentry]({}/swc-governors)'.format(topicbox)}}

These mailing lists are configured so that anyone can send a message to them, but list membership is moderated so that only current members of the committee will receive messages sent to the group.

To join one or more Carpentries mailing lists, you will need to {{'[create a login]({}/latest)'.format(topicbox)}}. Once you have done this, you can scroll through the list of groups and click “Join the Conversation” (for open mailing) or “Request to Join” (for those mailing lists requiring administrator approval).
