# Maintainers Handbook

The Carpentries Maintainers work with the community to make sure that
lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive. Maintainers
monitor their lesson repository, make sure that pull requests and issues
are addressed in a timely manner, and participate in the lesson
development cycle including lesson releases. They endeavour to be
welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the
community. This community of practice is a great place to learn to
collaborate effectively in Git and GitHub.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The Carpentries teaches 400–600 workshops each year, meaning our lesson
materials are being used practically every day for synchronous, guided
learning. Making sure our lessons keep working without interruptions is
therefore our number one goal for maintenance.

A secondary (but still extremely important!) goal is ensuring that the
spaces we use for lesson development and maintenance are just as
welcoming and inclusive as our workshops.

Ensuring that our lessons are on the cutting-edge of new technology and
tooling is *not* a priority for The Carpentries. Although we do want our
materials to stay relevant, it is far more important that our lessons
remain pedagogically sound and technically viable, than that they
represent the latest and greatest new developments in the field.

With these goals in mind, The Carpentries expectations of Maintainers
are to:

-  Monitor the lesson repository and make sure that pull requests (PRs)
   and Issues are responded to in a timely manner (even if that response
   is “sorry, this is out of scope”),
-  Do not introduce new errors into the lesson
-  Quickly fix anything that is unambiguously an error or that
   negatively affects workshop learners
-  Be receptive and welcoming to suggestions for improving the lessons
-  Evaluate all contributions in view of The Carpentries pedagogical
   model:

   -  Teach what is most relevant and useful for learners.
   -  Avoid unnecessary jargon and detailed explanations. Always ask
      yourself whether it is necessary for the learner.
   -  Keep language motivating.
   -  Meet learners where they are.
   -  Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.

Maintainers are responsible for:

-  Routinely:

   -  Ensuring reasonable response time to all submitted Issues and PRs.
      At a minimum, ensuring all Issues and PRs are acknowledged within
      two days.
   -  Quickly addressing issues and PRs tagged as “bug”s.
   -  Submitting Issues as they arise.
   -  Adhering to the Code of Conduct and alerting the Code of Conduct
      Committee to any potential violations.
   -  Identifying potential new Maintainers based on their review
      activity.

-  Periodically:

   -  Helping prepare lessons for publication.
   -  Bringing in updates to the lesson template.

Maintainers represent The Carpentries community and should strive to
embody The Carpentries philosophy, by:

-  Recognising the importance of communication and being welcoming to
   all contributors.
-  Giving feedback to contributors using The Carpentries model:

   -  Find what’s good. Be specific about improvements needed. Use
      motivational language.

-  Evaluating lesson contributions in light of Carpentries pedagogical
   model:

   -  Teach what’s most relevant and useful for learners.
   -  Avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
   -  Keep language motivating.
   -  Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.

## Onboarding


New Maintainers go through an onboarding process, led by a member of The
Carpentries Curriculum Team and the Maintainer Community Lead.
Maintainer Onboarding takes place at least once per year. New rounds of
onboarding will be announced on The Carpentries blog and main
communications channels (discuss TopicBox, general Slack channel).

The curriculum for onboarding new Maintainers is available as a
`Maintainer Onboarding
Lesson <https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/>`__.

## Offboarding

A yearly email with a one-question survey will be sent to Maintainers in
mid-to-late January. If the Maintainer responds “yes” to this survey,
they will remain a Maintainer for the next year. If a Maintainer replies
“no” or does not respond within a month of receiving the survey, they
will become an alumnus Maintainer and their permissions to their
repository will be revoked. Active Maintainer status can be restored at
any time by contacting the Maintainer Community Lead. `The proposal for
yearly Maintainer check
ins <https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/19>`__ has
more detailed information. If a Maintainer would like to step away from
the role outside this schedule, they should inform the Maintainer
Community Lead and the other Maintainers on their lesson(s).

## Communication and Collaboration Spaces

-  Slack:

   -  `The invite-only #maintainers
      channel <https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C8H5LN44V>`__ on
      The Carpentries Slack workspace is a platform for the whole
      community to ask questions and engage in discussions around the
      subject of lesson maintenance. The Maintainer Community Lead and
      Curriculum Team members will also cross-post announcements
      relevant to the community to this channel.
   -  We recommend that Lesson Maintainers browse existing channels in
      the Slack workspace, for any that are relevant to the topic/domain
      of their lesson.
   -  It can also be helpful to create a new channel for your lesson, as
      a space for you to discuss the development process with
      collaborators, and for community members to ask questions about
      the lesson.

-  `The Maintainers mailing
   list <https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers>`__ is used
   for announcements relevant to Lesson Maintainers.
-  Monthly Calls:

   -  The Carpentries Curriculum Team organises monthly Maintainer
      Community Calls on the third Wednesday of the month at two times
      to allow maintainers from around the globe to join during more
      convenient hours. Minutes are recorded in the
      `maintainer-resources
      repository <https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-resources>`__.

### Community Calendar

Once scheduled, all Maintainer Community Calls are listed on our
`Community

## Step-by-Step Guides

### Using Issue Labels to Promote Collaboration

GitHub allows the Maintainers of a repository to add contextual
information to Issues and Pull Requests in the form of labels. Two
labels, used by The Carpentries and in many repositories across GitHub,
can be deployed to increase the visibility of your lesson and encourage
community members to contribute to its development.

The **“help wanted”** label should be used to highlight issues with
which you would welcome additional help. The Carpentries website
includes\ `a Help Wanted
page <https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/>`__, which can
automatically list every issue labelled “help wanted” on repositories
from The Carpentries, Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library
Carpentry, CarpentriesLab, and The Carpentries Incubator. Find out how
to include issues from your lesson repository on the Help Wanted page by
reading the\ `Information for
Maintainers <https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/#for-maintainers>`__
on the page itself.

The **“good first issue”** label should be used to identify issues that
would make a good entry point for newcomers searching for a way to
contribute to your lesson. The work needed to close an issue with this
label would typically not require an extensive knowledge of the
structure or intricacies of your lesson repository, or an expert
understanding of the content. The “good first issue” label is used so
extensively that GitHub provides a page at\ `[repository
URL]/contribute <https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/contribute>`__
for every repository, listing issues with this label.

### Adding Topic Tags to a Lesson Repository

`Official Lessons in The Carpentries Lesson
Programs <https://carpentries.org>`__
are\ ` <https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/>`__\ listed on The
Carpentries website, based on metadata describing the lesson. This
metadata is added in the form of topic tags on the lesson repository.
These topic tags should be set as soon as possible after the lesson has
been created or added to the Incubator. Some are essential and taken
from a limited set of values, while others are more flexible. The table
below has guidance about the types and number of topic tags each lesson
repository should have.


.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20,20,10,50
   :delim: ,
   :header-rows: 1

   Category, Example, Number, Description
   Lesson, lesson, 1, Must be lesson to be listed on the Community Developed Lessons page
   Location, data-carpentry, 1, "A description of what lesson program the lesson belongs to with words separated by hyphens (i.e software-carpentry, data-carpentry, and library-carpentry)"
   Language,español,>0,The language(s) the lesson is available in
   Stage,stable,1,The current development stage for the lesson
   Domain,microbial-ecology,1-2,The high-level domain(s) of the lesson for a general categorization
   Tools,python,1-3,The main tool(s) taught in the lesson
   Skills,taxonomic-classification,1-3,The main skill(s) taught in the lesson

The Curriculum Team will support you in setting appropriate topic tags
for your lesson. To help ensure consistency across all lesson
repositories developed by The Carpentries community, please refer
to\ `this
listing <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KkmBtCu4PaNb5nzJAD82UHcfHQlaPY84qPVxw8WO8es/edit?usp=sharing>`__
of topic tags currently in use in The Carpentries Incubator, and re-use
these values where appropriate, creating new topic tags where no
pre-existing label exists for your lesson.

### Informing Community Members about a Period of Absence

If you plan to temporarily step away from the role of Maintainer,
e.g. parental leave, exam season, etc, it can be helpful to your fellow
lesson Maintainers and potential contributors to let them know. Here are
some steps you can take to notify the community about your temporary
absence/unavailability:

1. Set a status and mark yourself as “busy” on GitHub:

   1. Log into GitHub.com
   2. Click on your profile picture at the top-right of the window
   3. Select “Set status”
   4. In the “What’s happening?” box, write a short statement that lets
      other users know you are unavailable. You don’t have to tell
      people why - your status could be “temporarily unavailable” or
      “unavailable until DATE” to tell people when they can expect to
      find you back on GitHub. You can choose an emoji to accompany your
      status by clicking on the face icon next to the status message
      input.
   5. Check the “Busy” box, so that other users will receive a
      notification from GitHub about your status when they mention you
      in issues and pull requests, assign you to an issue, or request a
      review from you.
   6. **You can also set a status on Slack**. The process is very
      similar to GitHub’s, i.e. you should log in, click on your profile
      picture at the top-right of the window, and select “Update your
      status”. That will open a pop-up where you can write a status
      message.

2. Inform your co-Maintainers:

   7. Send them an email or a direct message on Slack.
   8. If you need help finding contact information for any of your
      fellow Maintainers, contact the Maintainer Community Lead.
