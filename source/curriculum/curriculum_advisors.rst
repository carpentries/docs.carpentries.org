Curriculum Advisors Handbook
============================

Curriculum Advisors are part of a team that provides the oversight,
vision, and leadership for a particular set of lessons. Curriculum
Advisors represent The Carpentries community and should strive to embody
The Carpentries philosophy by:

-  Recognising the importance of communication and being welcoming to
   all contributors.
-  Giving feedback to contributors using The Carpentries model:

   -  Finding what is good.
   -  Being specific about improvements needed.
   -  Using motivational language.

-  Evaluating lesson contributions in light of The Carpentries
   pedagogical model:

   -  Teaching what is most relevant and useful for learners.
   -  Avoiding getting bogged down in technical details.
   -  Keeping language motivating.
   -  Emphasising the importance of continued learning and improvement.

Roles and Responsibilities

-  Prepare meeting minutes and post to the appropriate CAC repository.
-  Fulfill all other responsibilities of a CAC member.

Other members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Notify Chair of potential agenda items as they arise.
-  Review agenda and other relevant documents sent by Chair prior to
   meeting.
-  Attend and actively participate in regular meetings by being
   attentive, sharing knowledge, expertise, ideas, and information.

Onboarding
----------

-  CAC recruitment takes place annually, based on term limits and
   turnover within committees.
-  Rounds of recruitment will be announced on `The Carpentries
   blog <https://carpentries.org/blog/>`__.
-  Volunteers will be asked to apply for the role by filling in a short
   webform describing their expertise and motivation for joining a
   committee.
-  Templates and workflows for CAC recruitment and onboarding are
   maintained in `the Core Team wiki (internal access
   only) <https://github.com/carpentries/core-team-wiki/tree/main/curriculum>`__.
-  Onboarding aims to provide new Curriculum Advisors with context for
   the role and how CACs fit into The Carpentries model for curriculum
   development and maintenance, and what they can expect as they prepare
   to join their first committee meeting.
-  Onboarding for Curriculum Advisors takes place in two parts:

   1. A general onboarding for all Curriculum Advisors
   2. An additional onboarding for the committee officers (*Roles and
      responsibilities*)

-  Both onboardings are delivered by the Curriculum Team over Zoom, with
   the possibility to be onboarded through a recording of the sessions
   available for those who cannot attend synchronously.
-  Onboarding slides:

   1. `general onboarding
      slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xuMCP43EUvmFqvHDX9w4BwOdvWMDcjW0BGxyOQVFSBs/edit?usp=sharing>`__
   2. `officer onboarding
      slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZmV-EfYXnMo2H2aBqqJo1eIMP1kpzeX5pherky-Cho/edit?usp=sharing>`__

-  After these onboarding sessions, Curriculum Advisors should complete
   the following steps:

   1. `Log into AMY <amy_link_>`_ with GitHub
      credentials and update their profile.

      -  When updating their AMY profile, it is essential that Advisors
         give consent for The Carpentries to publish their profile so
         that they can be listed on The Carpentries websites.

   2. Join the mailing list for their committee on `The Carpentries
      TopicBox <https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups>`__. CAC mailing
      lists are named with the prefix “curriculum-advisors-“.

      -  These mailing lists are configured so that anyone can send a
         message to them, but list membership is moderated so that only
         current members of the committee will receive messages sent to
         the group.

   3. Subscribe to notifications from the GitHub repositories for the
      lessons in their curriculum.

      -  This is only *required* for CAC chairs, but is recommended for
         all Curriculum Advisors as a way to stay up-to-date about
         discussions and developments taking place on their curriculum.
      -  Repositories are linked from the “Repository” column of the
         lesson tables in the “Lessons” page of each Lesson Program
         website:

         -  `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/>`__
         -  `Library
            Carpentry <https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/>`__
         -  `Software
            Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>`__

Term Length
~~~~~~~~~~~

Curriculum Advisors are expected to serve a two-year term.

Offboarding
-----------

We understand that circumstances can change and priorities must be
re-evaluated. If a Curriculum Advisor needs to step away from the role
before the end of their two-year term, the Curriculum Team will support
them to do this.

1. After the first year, the Curriculum Team will approach Curriculum
   Advisors to confirm that they wish to continue in the role or to step
   back.
2. If an Advisor needs to step away from the role outside this schedule,
   they should inform their committee Chair and `the Curriculum
   Team <mailto:curriculum@carpentries.org>`__.

Communication and Collaboration Spaces
--------------------------------------

Below is a list of communication channels and collaboration spaces that
support Curriculum Advisors. Participants in these channels and spaces
are expected to follow our `code of
conduct <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html>`__.

Meetings
~~~~~~~~

Each Curriculum Advisory Committee will meet at least quarterly, and
preferably every two months. These meetings are the primary avenue
through which CAC members will interact, and should follow best
practices for The Carpentries meetings, including having meeting roles,
taking notes, and creating and holding a space for everyone to
contribute. CAC members should prepare for meetings by reviewing and
contributing to relevant documents in advance of the meeting.

GitHub Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These repositories serve as a public record of meeting notes and
decisions made by each of the following CACs.

-  `Data Carpentry Curriculum
   Advisors <https://github.com/datacarpentry/curriculum-advisors>`__
-  `Library Carpentry Curriculum
   Advisors <https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors>`__
-  `Software Carpentry Curriculum
   Advisors <https://github.com/swcarpentry/curriculum-advisors>`__

Collaborative Notetaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Carpentries uses `Etherpad <https://etherpad.org/>`__ as a
collaborative note-taking tool during workshops, trainings, and other
Carpentries related events. Pads are synchronised as you type so that
everyone viewing the page sees the same text. This allows everyone to
collaborate simultaneously on documents. Below is a list of Etherpads
relevant to serving as a Curriculum Advisor.

-  `Pad-of-pads <https://pad.carpentries.org/pad-of-pads>`__: A list of
   our most commonly used Etherpads and other resources.
-  `Software Carpentry CAC pad <https://pad.carpentries.org/swc-cac>`__
-  `Library Carpentry CAC pad <https://pad.carpentries.org/lc-cac>`__
-  `DC Image CAC pad
   (CodiMD) <https://codimd.carpentries.org/92xFxRMKQhqnoeb6Bo_iXw#>`__
-  `DC Geospatial CAC pad <https://pad.carpentries.org/geospatialCAC>`__
-  `DC Genomics CAC
   pad <https://pad.carpentries.org/genomics_CAC_meeting>`__

Please note that use of this service is restricted to members of The
Carpentries community; it is not for general purpose use. All Etherpad
content is publicly available under the `Creative Commons Attribution
Licence <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__.

Messaging and Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Carpentries uses two primary tools for supporting communications
among our members: Slack and TopicBox. We know that everyone has
different communication preferences, so announcements and updates coming
from members of the Core Team are posted to both channels.

Slack
^^^^^

`Slack <https://slack.com>`__ is a communications platform adopted by
The Carpentries for instant messaging as well as synchronous and
asynchronous collaboration. If you are new to Slack, please checkout our
`Slack Quick Start
Guide <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html#slack-quick-start-guide>`__.

There are many curriculum-specific channels. We recommend that
Curriculum Advisors join the channels for all lessons within their
curriculum. Lesson-specific channels can usually be found based on a
common prefix based on the lesson program they belong to (“swc-” for
Software Carpentry, “lc-” for Library Carpentry, and “dc-” for Data
Carpentry)

`To join The Carpentries Slack workspace, you can follow this
link. <https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/>`__

Mailing List
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can access all The Carpentries mailing lists from
`TopicBox <https://carpentries.topicbox.com/latest>`__. There are
numerous mailing lists you can join based on the volunteer roles you are
supporting and your interests. Below is a list of mailing lists relevant

Curriculum Advisory Committee Consultation Rubric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*This rubric defines the division of responsibilities between The
Carpentries Maintainers and The Carpentries Curriculum Advisory
Committees (CACs).*

Issues over which Maintainers have full authority and which do not need CAC involvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Addition or removal of exercises
-  Reorganisation of material within episodes
-  Addition or removal of callout boxes
-  Addition or removal of or changes to figures
-  Changes to episode timings
-  Changes to lesson text

Issues about which Maintainers should consult the CAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Any new versions of a dataset (either a new release or a modification
   of existing data)
-  Any major adjustments to the lesson (e.g., episode order,
   passwordless access)
-  Any updates to a lesson that Maintainers wish to share for
   informational purposes

Issues that may benefit from Maintainers consulting with the CAC, but over which Maintainers retain authority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Addition of a new library or package
-  Introduction of a new topic / learning objective (e.g., adding file
   permissions to LC shell lesson)
-  Updates to software/packages that are minor versions (e.g., Python
   3.7 -> 3.8) when the new version is backwards compatible with current
   version
-  Additions of experimental features (e.g., git checkout → git restore
   / git switch)
-  Any change to a lesson that impacts the content/scope of another
   lesson in the curriculum
-  For Incubator lessons - Review of a lesson outline where lesson
   developers would like the lesson to be considered for eventual
   adoption into a Lesson Program’s official curriculum
-  Issues which are not covered anywhere else in this rubric

Issues for which Maintainers must seek CAC approval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Replacing the dataset used in the lesson with a different dataset.
   This does not include cases in which the data being used in the
   lesson is being updated to a new version (e.g., a new data release)
   or is modified to make it more suitable for the teaching environment
   (e.g., introduction of messiness to the dataset).
-  Changing the software being used in the lesson. This does not include
   updating to a new stable, backwards-compatible version of the
   existing software (e.g., Python 3.6 → 3.7.x), but does include:

   -  Updating to a non-backwards compatible version of existing
      software (e.g., Python 2.x → 3.x, R 3.x → 4.x)
   -  Change in plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn,
      ggplot, Altair)
   -  Change in libraries / packages taught (i.e., removal or
      replacement)
   -  Change in SQL dialect (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL
      Server)
   -  Change in IDE being used to teach the lessons (RStudio, Jupyter
      Notebook)
   -  Change from GitHub as remote hosting platform to a different
      remote hosting platform, e.g., GitLab

-  Removal of an entire episode’s worth of content
-  Change in lesson infrastructure (e.g., moving Genomics lessons from
   AWS to CyVerse)
-  Retirement of a lesson (e.g., MATLAB, Mercurial)
-  Addition of a new lesson to the core curriculum (e.g., adding Julia
   as an alternative to R / Python)
-  Adding or removing prerequisites from a lesson (for curricula with
   multiple lessons)
-  Promotion or graduation of a lesson from alpha to beta to stable.
   Decisions on approval can be based on recommendations from the
   Curriculum Team, CAC member involvement in lesson pilot workshops,
   and/or open peer review of lessons in The Carpentries Lab.
