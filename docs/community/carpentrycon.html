<h2>Description of CarpentryCon<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-carpentrycon" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>CarpentryCon is The Carpentries key biennial community-building and networking event that brings together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, to network, to develop new skills, and to develop strategies for building strong local communities. This handbook details what is needed to run a fully virtual event with a focus on accessibility and inclusivity. A handbook detailing a hybrid event will be developed and made available at a later time.</p>
<section id="roles-and-responsibilities-of-committee-members">
<h3>Roles and Responsibilities of Committee Members<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-and-responsibilities-of-committee-members" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The CarpentryCon Committee for a virtual event should include no more than ten community members and two primary Core Team liaisons. To support planning across time zones, there should be an Eastern Committee and Western Committee that has members located in time zones within the eastern and western hemispheres. Each group will include individuals serving in the following roles: <a class="reference internal" href="#chairs"><span class="std std-doc">Committee Chair</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#program-lead"><span class="std std-doc">Program Lead</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#communications-lead"><span class="std std-doc">Communications Lead</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#accessibility-lead"><span class="std std-doc">Accessibility Lead</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#core-team-members"><span class="std std-doc">Core Team Liaison</span></a>.</p>
<p>This section of the handbook includes the roles and responsibilities of each committee member with a link to relevant guides and resources and the time commitment required. All time estimates are approximated based on implementation of past events.</p>
<section id="chairs">
<h4>Chairs<a class="headerlink" href="#chairs" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>

<h3>Onboarding Committee Members<a class="headerlink" href="#onboarding-committee-members" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When onboarding new members, roles and responsibilities need to be clearly defined and communicated. This is especially important for distinguishing tasks that need to be community-led and those tasks that should be the responsibility of the Core Team. Considerations include: ensuring the event is driven by community needs and interests, what are appropriate contributions for volunteers, and who can access planning and event platforms. It will be important to document how decisions will be made to bring further clarity to how Committee members will collaborate.</p>
<p>The following tasks need to be completed by the Core Team liaisons to onboard new Committee members.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tasks to complete before onboarding Committee members at their first meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set up a project in Asana using the CarpentryCon template. Make adjustments as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a Google drive folder with relevant files, copying over templates from previous years.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a mailing list for the committee and Core Team liaisons. Only have <strong>one mailing list</strong> or other communication channel to increase transparency and streamline communications.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Schedule a one-hour meeting for east and west Committee members. You will likely need to have two meetings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can adapt the <a class="reference internal" href="#carpentrycon-2022-committee-onboarding-presentation"><span class="std std-doc">CarpentryCon 2022 Committee Onboarding Presentation</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the meeting, you should inform committee members that you will be adding them to the Asana project, Google drive folder, and the mailing list. Do not send invitations to Committee members before this meeting to avoid confusion. This will ensure they know to watch out for communications to join these various platforms and how they will be used.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tasks to complete after onboarding Committee members at their first meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add all Committee members to Asana, Google Drive (provide edit access), and the mailing list.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a communication via the mailing list that they have been added to the various platforms and to contact the Core Team liaisons if there are any issues with access.</p></li>

<p>Until an open source platform is identified that supports the committee’s task management needs, Asana will be used. Asana is a project management tool used by The Carpentries Core Team that allows access to external project contributors. All members of the Committee will be added to the CarpentryCon Asana project for that year and be given an overview of the tool as part of onboarding. The project will include a list of tasks to complete, an assignee to each task, and a deadline. Weekly updates will be posted to the project by a Core Team liaison to ensure the project stays on track.</p>

<h3>Process for Review of Proposal Submissions<a class="headerlink" href="#process-for-review-of-proposal-submissions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Preparation:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A decision should be made prior to the review of proposals on how many can be accepted in each category to fill the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Review should begin the day following the submission deadline.</p></li>
<li><p>A minimum of two weeks should be blocked to conduct the review, but the time required will be dependent on the number of proposals received and the number of reviewers.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>All reviewers should submit their reviews using the proposal submission form, which should be copied each year from the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1i2h6P36VDChkKn6bJwCXY_vo1s6NvLEfV3uM1hYlxf4/edit">proposal submission form template</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any submission not including all required content should be automatically rejected.</p></li>
<li><p>Each proposal should be assigned a minimum of two reviewers, with a third review brought in if the first two reviewers disagree on whether a proposal should be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>The following criteria should be considered by all reviewers. Each criterion should be given a score of 1 to indicate if a proposal is not ready, 2 if the proposal has potential and 3 if the proposal is a good fit. It is up to the discretion of the Program Leads, in consultation with other Committee members, as to whether to request an updated proposal for those submissions initially rejected.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Level of Preparation</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>1 (not ready) The proposal is unclear or not well developed</p></li>
<li><p>2 (has potential) The proposed session needs minor revisions to meet carpentries’ expectations and available evidence of expertise suggests the applicant can do so successfully</p></li>
<li><p>3 (good fit) The applicant’s proposal and other evidence of expertise suggests they understand how their session fits into the event and can make an achievable contribution with the session</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Scope of Session</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>1 (not ready) Scope of session is either too broad to be reasonably covered in session, or too narrow to reasonably fill any of the conference session types</p></li>
<li><p>2 (has potential) Scope is clear but may need tailoring to fit in conference sessions</p></li>
<li><p>3 (good fit) Scope of planned material fits well within the framework of conference sessions</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Fit with theme</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>1 (not ready) The proposal is not well aligned or too vague to determine if it fits the theme of “Expanding data frontiers”</p></li>
<li><p>2 (has potential) Has potential to be valuable and could be appropriate for theme, with revision or elaboration</p></li>
<li><p>3 (good fit) Proposed topic resonates/fits well with the conference theme and is likely to help wider community</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Fit with Carpentries’ mission and values</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>1 (not ready) Value of session is unclear, misaligned, or in conflict with Carpentries’ mission and values</p></li>
<li><p>2 (has potential) Session does not conflict with Carpentries’ mission and values, has potential to advance them with refinement</p></li>
<li><p>3 (good fit) Proposed topic clearly upholds and/or advances Carpentries’ mission and values</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Openness to collaboration</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>1 (not ready) Seems closed to collaborative ways of working</p></li>
<li><p>2 (has potential) Seems open to involving others but without clear ways of doing so</p></li>
<li><p>3 (good fit) Sees value in involving others and proposes workable ways of engagement</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Reviewers are also asked whether they would recommend an application. The available answers are “No”, “Yes”, “Unsure” or “Wild-Card/Red-Flag (request to discuss)”. Proposals who have ratings of “No” or “Unsure” across all reviewers will be rejected. All other candidates will be discussed at the panel selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Section should be included for reviewers to write comments if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>We ask all reviewers to finish the review with a few summary sentences to describe the application and the motivations for their scores to facilitate conversation during the selection panel discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>A selection panel discussion should be scheduled to discuss those proposals, focusing on those proposals without reviewer alignment in the recommendation on the proposal.</p></li>

<section id="creating-program-and-schedule">
<h3>Creating Program and Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-program-and-schedule" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are many ways that someone can pull together the program and schedule once all the sessions have been identified. This guide is a recommendation so Program Leads should feel free to modify it to what works best for them.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use the <a class="reference internal" href="#time-blocks-and-scheduling-spreadsheet"><span class="std std-doc">Time Blocks and Scheduling Spreadsheet</span></a> to record information on each accepted session by type. Selection will have been based on the number of sessions needed by type to feel the program (Step 1 of <a class="reference internal" href="#process-for-review-of-proposal-submissions"><span class="std std-doc">Process for Review of Proposal Submissions)</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer the relevant information for each session from the <a class="reference internal" href="#proposal-confirmation-of-acceptance-form-template"><span class="std std-doc">Proposal Confirmation of Acceptance Form Template</span></a> into the spreadsheet as described in the README tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new spreadsheet with the dates and times available to schedule the program. Doing this will allow you to view the Time Blocks and Scheduling Spreadsheet in a separate window. We recommend listing the times in 10 minute increments to make it easier to build in concurrent sessions, sessions lasting 1.5 hours and breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Build the schedule, noting the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ensure the schedule includes programming across each of the three primary time blocks. The target for number of sessions by type within each time block can be found in Appendix A of the <a class="reference internal" href="#carpentrycon-2022-evaluation-report"><span class="std std-doc">CarpentryCon 2022 Evaluation Report</span></a>. Consider those sessions that can be repeated.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure sessions are scheduled when presenters and sessions leads confirmed their availability.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not run programming for more than 3 consecutive hours. Three hours is a long time to be attentive in a virtual space even with breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave time for participant breaks, lasting a minimum of ten minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave time to transition virtual rooms between sessions. In some cases, the volunteers supporting the next session will be rotating and will need time to get set up.</p></li>
<li><p>Lightning talks can be grouped by theme. In 2022, each lightning talk session lasted 50 minutes. Five 5-minute talks were aired followed by a breakout discussion (Resource: <span class="xref myst">Email on how lightning talk session will run</span>).</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Have all members of the CarpentryCon Committee review the draft schedule at the next meeting, identifying any concerns or changes that need to be made.</p></li>
<li><p>Finalize the draft schedule based on the meeting discussion.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#proposal-decision-email-templates"><span class="std std-doc">Send an email</span></a> to the session lead to confirm the date and time of the session(s) they will be leading.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor responses to the <a class="reference internal" href="#proposal-confirmation-of-acceptance-form-template"><span class="std std-doc">Proposal Confirmation of Acceptance Form</span></a> so communications can be sent out quickly to reschedule sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all sessions have been confirmed, finalize schedule and add to conference website.</p></li>

<h3>Setting Up Conference Session Etherpads<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-conference-session-etherpads" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>

<p><em>Email communication sent to committee members following CarpentryCon. It requests that they complete the feedback form and send their address for sending a thank you gift.</em></p>
<p>Hello CarpentryCon Committee members,</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you for your support of CarpentryCon! We could not have done it without you. It was a busy week, but I think we delivered a great event for the community. I just sent out a request for those who registered to complete a post-conference evaluation, and I will share the results back to all of you.</p>
<p>There are a couple of follow-up requests I have for you:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Please take some time to provide your feedback on your experience as a Committee member [LINK TO [COMMITTEE MEMBER FEEDBACK FORM](#committee-member-feedback-form]. This really helps us improve the experience for future Committee members and should not take more than 5-10 minutes, depending on the amount of feedback you want to provide. If you prefer, I’m also happy to set up a phone call to chat.</p></li>
<li><p>We would also like to send a thank you gift to each of you for your service. Please send us your name and mailing address for shipping the items to carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks again for your contributions to this important event for our community. It is so very much appreciated, [NAME]</p>

<h4>Accessibility Audit for CarpentryCon 2022<a class="headerlink" href="#accessibility-audit-for-carpentrycon-2022" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<section id="id7">
<h5>About this resource<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p><em>This audit was conducted by the Accessibility Manager for The Carpentries for CarpentryCon 2022. It assessed the accessibility of all platforms used for the event, including Zoom, Etherpad, and YouTube.</em></p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>In preparation to make CarpentryCon as accessible as possible, we knew we needed a video conferencing software, a real time note taking program, and platform to show videos and allow users to view sessions post conference. The top three choices for these programs were Zoom, Etherpad, and YouTube. In looking for accessible options it was important to have programs that could be accessed on a variety of operating systems and meet WCAG standards including being screen reader compatible and captions for video platforms.</p>
<p>Zoom</p>
<p>Zoom can be used on a variety of devices including, desktop, mobile devices that use Windows, MacOS, Linux, Chrome OS, iOS, Android and Blackberry or users can dial in on a phone line to participate.</p>
<p>Zoom can be used with screen readers - most commonly JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and Android Talkback. Zoom can be controlled with Keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Zoom has auto generated captions, allows for someone to type in captions, and integrates with third-party closed captions.</p>
<p>Video options for Zoom include multi-spotlights - meeting hosts can pin a specific speaker(s) to allow for the sign language interpreters to be pinned.</p>
<p>Multi-pinning and changing the gallery view allows individuals to rearrange and view specific tiles.</p>
<p>Text settings in chat and for captions can be customised.</p>
<p>When using breakout rooms, captions are not usable.</p>
<p>Most importantly Zoom meets WCAG 2.1 AA Standards, a set of global standards that we value. The Carpentries already used Zoom for a number of community meetings, so members of the community did not have to get used to another platform.</p>
<p>Etherpad</p>
<p>Etherpad can be used with a variety of devices and operating systems.</p>
<p>Etherpad is fully screen reader accessible.</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are usable with Etherpad.</p>
<p>Users can choose background and font text and colour.</p>
<p>The Carpentries chose to use the Etherpad for collaborative notes because many community members are used to this platform and it has features that make it accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>YouTube can be used with a variety of devices and operating systems.</p>
<p>Youtube is screen reader accessible.</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are usable with Youtube.</p>
<p>Users can choose background and font text and colour.</p>
<p>Related to videos on YouTube, captions can be added to videos and in a variety of languages. Youtube also has automated captions that can help provide a transcript of a file and then be edited for accuracy. It is The Carpentries practice to add captions in at least one language.</p>
<p>During the Conference</p>
<p>To support accessibility during CarpentryCon we provide Sign Language interpreters for the Keynote sessions and would have provided them for other sessions as requested. All sessions were closed captioned in English. Spanish translation was provided as requested. There was one keynote presented in Spanish, this was captioned in Spanish and English and Interpreted into American Sign Language.</p>
<p>During the conference Zoom helpers were given information on how to turn captioning on and how to identify and assign the captioner to type. During the interpreted session, a Carpentries CoreCare Team member was in charge of pinning the speaker and the interpreter in zoom so they could be easily seen.</p>

<p>Dear [NAME],</p>
<p>On behalf of the CarpentryCon [YEAR] Committee, I would like to invite you to be a keynote speaker at this year’s event [LINK TO WEBSITE], which will take place online from [EVENT DATES].</p>
<p>CarpentryCon aims to develop the next generation of diverse, international research and data leaders. Unlike conferences that focus on advances within a discipline, CarpentryCon will teach the practical skills people need to lead 21st century research within academia and industry. The theme of this year’s conference is [ADD THEME] to advance open research and data skills beyond borders with a focus on skill development, community building, co-creation of open source resources, and networking. If you would like to learn more, please take a look at the CarpentryCon [YEAR] schedule [LINK TO PAST CONFERENCE WEBSITE] and recordings [LINK TO YOUTUBE].</p>
<p>Keynote sessions will be 50 minutes, which includes 40 minutes for the talk and 10 minutes for questions and discussion. As a recognized expert in [ADD CUSTOMIZATION], we invite you to present [ADD CUSTOMIZATION]. Your story and vision for the field will facilitate discussion sessions that will be held throughout the event and will ensure conference attendees leave with a better understanding of [ADD CUSTOMIZATION].</p>
<p>If you are able to accept our invitation, please let us know by [DEADLINE]. We will need to approach potential replacement speakers if you are unable to attend. If you can’t join us this time, please let us know if you would be willing to participate in a future event.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope you will be able to join us at CarpentryCon and be a part of this growing community.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration,</p>
<p>[NAME]</p>

<p><em>An example email for communicating with lightning talk presenters and session supporters on how the lightning talk sessions will run.</em></p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>This email is being sent to all lightning talk presenters, facilitators, Zoom helpers, and their backups to provide you with detailed information about how those sessions will be ran. As a reminder, the lightning talks sessions are going to be repeated three times during each of our three primary time blocks set up for CarpentryCon. This is to make the event more accessible to our global audience. For many of us, the first session will be hosted Sunday night, which is Monday morning in Oceania. Lightning talk presenters have been asked to attend the sessions in which their presentation is being aired, but this is not a requirement because it could be aired in the middle of the night for them. Therefore, these sessions are being set up a bit differently than the others. I wanted to provide these details for you so you have them, but members of the Core Team will be the primary facilitators for these sessions and will be there to provide support as needed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The main facilitator (a member of the Core Team) will live stream the videos of each lightning talk from their computer. All videos will include Spanish and English captions. More languages will be added once the videos have been uploaded to YouTube.</p></li>
<li><p>After the videos have been aired, we will be going into breakout rooms so attendees can discuss the content from the presentations. The number of breakout rooms will be dependent on the number of attendees, but the rooms will be set up where attendees can choose the room they want to join:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Room 1 will be named “Captioner,” and the live captioner will join this room for anyone needing live closed captioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Room 2 will be named “En Español,” and will be a room that attendees can join if they want to discuss the presentations in Spanish. Each of the three themed sessions has at least one presentation given in Spanish.</p></li>
<li><p>Rooms 3-x will not need a name and the number of rooms required will be dependent on the number of participants (with ~5-8 per room). <strong>We will ask the presenters attending each session to put in the chat which room they will be joining so attendees know where to go if they have a question for them. Presenters are welcome to join the “captioner” or “en español” rooms if that is their preference, and multiple presenters can be in the same room.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again everyone for all of your efforts to support CarpentryCon and please email carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your participation in CarpentryCon [YEAR] as a lightning talk presenter! As a reminder, the video of your lightning talk should be uploaded to this Google drive [LINK TO GOOGLE DRIVE] by [DATE] in a digital format with high-quality audio and discernable speech. This will allow us time to add captioning in multiple languages to your videos and get them uploaded to YouTube before the start of the event on [DATE]. Lightning talks are strictly limited to 5 minutes and we ask all presenters to follow these guidelines to ensure their presentation is accessible to all attendees [LINK TO ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES FOR PRESENTERS]. Please let us know if you have any questions and don’t forget to register if you have not already done so [LINK TO REGISTRATION]. Thanks again, [NAME]</p>

<p>Hey CarpentryCon Session Leads and Co-Leads,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support of CarpentryCon [YEAR]. As of today, we have [NUMBER REGISTERED] people who have registered to attend so we’re looking forward to an exciting event. I want to share some information with all of you as you prepare for your sessions over the next two weeks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you have not already done so, be sure to register for the event (it is free!) [LINK TO REGISTRATION]. Please note that you will need to register separately for any sessions that you would like to attend that have an attendance cap. They are marked with an R on the schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>If your session is one that had an attendance cap, we will send you information on who has registered no later than 24 hours before the start of your event. If you need that information sooner, please email carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org.</p></li>
<li><p>For each session, we will be assigning a volunteer facilitator and Zoom helper. Facilitators will have a script to open up each session, which will include important information that participants need to know (e.g., code of conduct). They will also be available to support other aspects of your session as needed. Zoom helpers will be available to support all things Zoom related, including connecting your session to our live closed captioning service. Once a facilitator and Zoom helper have been identified for your session, we will send a communication out to the whole group so you can coordinate as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>A volunteer from the CarpentryCon Committee set up an Etherpad for all sessions. You will find it linked to the calendar invite you received for your session. If you have not received a calendar invite or are having trouble finding the link to your session’s Etherpad, please email carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org. You are welcome to add any content you would like to your Etherpad, and these will be available for collaborative note-taking throughout your session.</p></li>
<li><p>As a reminder, we have set up a folder for each CarpentryCon session so you can upload your presentations and any related materials. Please do this by [DATE]. Members of the community who have already registered have requested access to materials in advance so this will ensure we make the event as accessible as possible. A README is available in the parent folder (CarpentryCon [YEAR] Session Materials) with additional instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have any questions moving forward, please direct them to carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org. All members of the Core Team will be monitoring this email address and will be able to get back to you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for your support of CarpentryCon. We look forward to welcoming you to the event in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><em>Example email sent to session leads one week prior to the start of the event.</em></p>
<p>Hey CarpentryCon Session Leads and Co-Leads,</p>
<p>With CarpentryCon only five days away, I wanted to provide you with some additional information to help you adequately prepare for your sessions. As of today, we have 391 individuals who have registered to attend.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to find a volunteer facilitator and Zoom helper for all sessions. You can find the sign-up sheet here [LINK TO VOLUNTEER SCHEDULE]. If you currently do not have a volunteer listed to support your session in either of these roles, please consider adding a name of a member of your team if anyone has the capacity to serve as a facilitator or Zoom helper during your session. You can view the Instructions for Facilitators [LINK TO INSTRUCTIONS FOR FACILITATORS] and Instructions for Zoom Helpers [LINK TO INSTRUCTIONS FOR ZOOM HELPERS] to see what is involved. Members of the Core Team will be filling in the remaining slots as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom helpers and facilitators have been asked to log in at least ten minutes before the start of your session. Please use this time to coordinate with them to make sure your session runs smoothly (e.g., when to start/stop recording, needs for breakout rooms, identifying a notetaker). If you need more time, or would like to connect with your facilitator or Zoom helper directly to discuss details about your session, please email carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org so we can send out a communication to connect all of you.</p></li>
<li><p>An Etherpad has been set up for all sessions. However, if you do not want to use the Etherpad for collaborative notetaking, please add a note to the Etherpad re-directing attendees to the appropriate location. The Etherpad contains additional information important for participants, so we want to maintain that as a resource for all sessions. As a reminder, you will find your Etherpad linked to the calendar invite you received for your session.</p></li>
<li><p>Related to above, everyone who would like to attend your session may not be able to. Therefore, we added a section to all of the Etherpads where participants can add questions for you to answer asynchronously. Please respond to these questions when you have time as the Etherpads will be serving as a resource for the community during and after the event. This is why it is also important to have a dedicated notetaker for your session.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have not, be sure to upload your presentations and any other session materials to your session’s folder in the parent folder [LINK TO PARENT FOLDER] as soon as possible to make them available to attendees. A README is available in the parent folder with additional instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>For any sessions with an attendance cap, I will be sending an email out to you tomorrow with the number of attendees that have signed up for your session. We’ll also send an additional communication out 24 hours before your event so you can plan accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have any questions at all, please direct them to carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org. The entire Core Team will be monitoring this email address so that you will receive a faster response. You can also paste general questions into #carpentrycon in Slack or technical questions into #carpentrycon-helpdesk to get support as needed before and during your sessions. We have a host of volunteers monitoring those channels as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for your support of CarpentryCon. We look forward to welcoming you to the event next week!</p>

<p><em>Email communication sent to registrants two weeks from the start of CarpentryCon 2022.</em></p>
<p>We’re excited to have you joining us next week to launch CarpentryCon 2022!</p>
<p>To ensure you get the most out of your participation, we wanted to share some important information with you.</p>
<p>All conference participants must abide by The Carpentries Code of Conduct. If you have not already, please familiarize yourself with it before joining your first session at the conference.</p>
<p>The full conference schedule is available on the conference website. There have been a few updates to the schedule over the past few weeks (some sessions removed and others rescheduled) so be sure you have the most up-to-date information on the date and time of all sessions you wish to attend.</p>
<p>We’ll be using two Slack channels in The Carpentries workspace to support CarpentryCon. #carpentrycon will be used for announcements, initiating discussions relevant to sessions, and asking general questions about the event. Technical issues should be directed to #carpentrycon-helpdesk. If you are not on Slack, you can email carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org with any questions.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend a session but have a question for the presenter or session leads, please add those to the Etherpad of the appropriate session under “Questions for Presenters/Session Leads.” A link to each Etherpad is provided in the information for each session.</p>
<p>For anyone who asked for materials to be made available to them in advance, all session leads have been asked to upload materials to the Google folder CarpentryCon 2022 Session Materials by 27 July.</p>
<p>There are several sessions that require separate registration for CarpentryCon because they have an attendance cap. These sessions are listed below along with the link for registering for them. You can read abstracts for these sessions on the CarpentryCon website.</p>
<p>Name of Session - Date, Time in UTC (attendance cap of 20)</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please submit those to carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org. We look forward to welcoming you to the event in less than a week!</p>

<p>As a reminder and if you have not already, please take a little bit of your time today to provide us with feedback on your experience as a participant in CarpentryCon. The original email request can be found below. Your feedback helps our organisation plan future events, so thanks so much for your time.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Thank you for joining us for CarpentryCon 2022! If you joined one session or many over the two-week period, we were happy to have you with us.</p>
<p>Now that the event has ended, we would like to request your feedback on your conference experience. This event is for the community, so this allows you to let us know how to improve future events. The information you provide will also be used to report back to our funders, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. It should take no more than five minutes to complete, and your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>After the survey has been submitted, you will be given the option to provide a testimonial that will appear on The Carpentries website. This will be for our primary website, not the conference website, so we are looking for any testimonial about your experience as a member of the community. This is entirely optional, but it would be great to hear from many of you so we can highlight your experience with the organisation to showcase on the site. If you have any questions about the feedback form or the request for testimonials, please email community&#64;carpentries.org.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Please visit this spreadsheet [LINK TO VOLUNTEER SCHEDULE] to sign up for sessions that you would be interested in supporting by [DEADLINE]. Each tab of the spreadsheet provides a detailed schedule for each day of CarpentryCon. Add your name next to those sessions you can support following the guidelines provided in the README tab. You do not need to provide an email, as we can retrieve that information from your registration.</p>
<p>Once you have added your name as a primary or a backup, a calendar invite will be sent to you for the session you are assigned. We will also send a communication out to you, the facilitator, and the session co-leads so you can coordinate as needed. All the information you need to support you in your role will be sent to you no later than [DATE], a week before the start of the event. If you have any questions, please email carpentrycon&#64;carpentries.org.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>The CarpentryCon Committee</p>
