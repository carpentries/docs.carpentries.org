# Lesson Developers Handbook



## Description of Community Role

Lesson Developers create new lessons using The Carpentries open source lesson infrastructure. This lesson development takes place in The Carpentries Incubator, a space for the community to collaborate on lesson projects. 


### Roles and responsibilities

Beyond ensuring that the lesson remains compliant with [the requirements for inclusion in The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/blob/main/README.md#what-are-the-requirements-for-being-included-in-the-carpentries-incubator), there are no formal responsibilities associated with developing a lesson there: lesson projects in the Incubator are community efforts that belong to the individual developers contributing to them. These Developers can choose to manage them and commit time to them according to their preferences and availability.

To ensure the continuing health and sustainability of their lesson project, The Carpentries recommends that Lesson Developers make themselves responsible for the following tasks:



* Managing the design and development of the lesson.
* Reading, responding to, and (where necessary) handling issues reported by community members.
* Welcoming and reviewing pull requests and other contributions made by community members.
* Communicating with the community about the ongoing development of the lesson.
* Recruiting Instructors to beta test the lesson, supporting preparations for pilot workshops, and incorporating feedback from those workshops.
* Submitting the lesson for open peer review and acceptance to [The Carpentries Lab](https://carpentries-lab.org/).


### Onboarding

Lesson Developers can start a new lesson any time by [opening a new issue on The Carpentries Incubator Proposals repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=issue_proposal.md). The issue template includes several questions, which should be answered to help the Curriculum Team set up the lesson repository correctly in the Incubator.

Community members with an idea for a new lesson can also apply to join Collaborative Lesson Development Training, which will be scheduled periodically starting in 2023.


### Offboarding

There is no formal offboarding process for Lesson Developers working on projects in The Carpentries Incubator.

To ensure the continuing health and sustainability of the project, The Carpentries recommends that Lesson Developers take the following actions when stepping away from a lesson:



* Communicate the decision to the other developers of the lesson, so that they can redistribute tasks and plan the project accordingly.
* Re-assign any issues assigned to them, to another member of the lesson development team.
* Remove their name from the lesson README file and anywhere else where authors of the lesson are listed.
* Ask the project owner (a developer with Admin access to the repository) to revoke the outgoing developer’s privileges on the lesson repository.
* If the sole remaining developer of the lesson is leaving the project, add a notice to the top of the repository README and the lesson front page (`index.md`) to inform visitors that the lesson is not being actively maintained/developed. In these circumstances, consider:
    * 1. contacting the [Incubator administrator team](mailto:incubator@carpentries.org) to let them know that the lesson will be unmaintained, and
    * 2. archiving the lesson repository.

If the developers wish to remove the lesson from The Carpentries Incubator, the project owner (a developer with Admin access) can transfer the lesson repository out of the `carpentries-incubator` GitHub organisation via __Settings__->__General__->__Danger Zone__->__Transfer Ownership__.


## Communication and Collaboration Spaces



### Community Calendar

Once scheduled, all Lesson Development Coworking Sessions are listed on our [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events). You can add relevant events to your personal calendar from there by clicking on the event you would like to attend.


### Etherpad

Below is a list of Etherpads relevant to serving as a Lesson Developer. 



* [Pad-of-pads](https://pad.carpentries.org/pad-of-pads): A list of our most commonly used Etherpads and other resources.
* [Lesson Development Coworking Session Notes](https://codimd.carpentries.org/lessondev-coworking): Signup information, connection details, and notes taken from monthly coworking sessions (CodiMD),


### GitHub



* [The Carpentries Incubator Proposals repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals): a place for The Carpentries community to propose new lessons for development in the Incubator.
* [The Carpentries Lab Reviews repository](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews): a place for Lesson Developers to submit lessons for open peer review and acceptance to The Carpentries Lab. 


### Slack

[Join The Carpentries Slack workspace.](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) To follow conversations relevant to this role, you should join the following channels:



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The [#lesson-dev channel on The Carpentries Slack workspace](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C3KUTT5V3)</span> is a platform for the whole community to ask questions and engage in discussions around the subject of lesson development.
* We recommend that Lesson Developers browse existing channels in the Slack workspace, for any that are relevant to the topic/domain of their lesson.
* It can also be helpful to create a new channel for your lesson, as a space for you to discuss the development process with collaborators, and for community members to ask questions about the lesson.

If Slack is new to you, our [Slack Quick Start Guide](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html#slack-quick-start-guide) will help you to set up your profile and give you an overview of how we use the platform on a day-to-day basis.


### Mailing List

You can access The Carpentries mailing lists from [TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/latest). The [incubator-developers mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/incubator-developers) is the one relevant to serving in this role. 

To join one or more Carpentries mailing lists, you will need to [create a login on the site](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/latest). Once you have done this, you can scroll through the list of groups and click “Join the Conversation” (for open mailing) or “Request to Join” (for those mailing lists requiring administrator approval). 


## Step-by-Step Guides


### Adapting Existing Lessons for The Carpentries

Lessons must use The Carpentries template and infrastructure to be included in the Incubator or Lab. The Curriculum Development Handbook includes [a guide for adapting existing lessons to use The Carpentries lesson template](https://cdh.carpentries.org/adapting-existing-lessons-for-the-carpentries.html).


### Using Issue Labels to Promote Collaboration

GitHub allows the maintainers of a repository to add contextual information to Issues and Pull Requests in the form of labels. Two labels, used by The Carpentries and in many repositories across GitHub, can be deployed to increase the visibility of your lesson and encourage community members to contribute to its development.

The **“help wanted”** label should be used to highlight issues with which you would welcome additional help. The Carpentries website includes [a Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/), which can automatically list every issue labelled “help wanted” on repositories from The Carpentries, Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, CarpentriesLab, and The Carpentries Incubator. Find out how to include issues from your lesson repository on the Help Wanted page by reviewing the [Information for Maintainers](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/#for-maintainers) on the page itself.

The **“good first issue”** label should be used to identify issues that would make a good entry point for newcomers searching for a way to contribute to your lesson. The work needed to close an issue with this label would typically not require an extensive knowledge of the structure or intricacies of your lesson repository, or an expert understanding of the content. The “good first issue” label is used so extensively that GitHub provides a page at[ [repository URL]/contribute](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/contribute) for every repository, listing issues with this label.


### Adding Topic Tags to a Lesson Repository

[Lessons under community development in the Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/) are listed on The Carpentries website, based on metadata describing the lesson. This metadata is added in the form of topic tags on the lesson repository. These topic tags should be set as soon as possible after the lesson has been created or added to the Incubator. Some are essential and taken from a limited set of values, while others are more flexible. The table below has guidance about the types and number of topic tags each lesson repository should have.

_Categories marked with an asterisk (*) are required in order for a lesson to appear and be appropriately sorted on the [Community Developed Lessons page](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/)._

The Curriculum Team will support you in setting appropriate topic tags for your lesson. To help ensure consistency across all lesson repositories developed by The Carpentries community, please refer to this [listing of topic tags currently in use](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KkmBtCu4PaNb5nzJAD82UHcfHQlaPY84qPVxw8WO8es/edit?usp=sharing) in The Carpentries Incubator, and re-use these values where appropriate, creating new topic tags where no pre-existing label exists for your lesson.


### How to Organise a Lesson Development Sprint

Many Lesson Developers find it helpful to organise a dedicated event to make progress and enhance collaboration on their lesson projects. The Curriculum Development Handbook includes [a set of recommendations for how to organise an effective and inclusive lesson development sprint event](https://cdh.carpentries.org/lesson-sprint-recommendations.html).


### Promoting Your Project in The Incubator Lesson Spotlight

The Incubator Lesson Spotlight is a regular feature in The Carpentries blog and newsletter, highlighting a lesson currently under community development. The purpose of the Spotlight series is to raise the visibility of that lesson among the broader community, and to encourage community members to contribute to the further development of that lesson.

Any lesson in [The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/) is eligible to be included in the series, regardless of the stage of development that lesson is currently in. It is a good way for lessons in the early stages of development to attract new collaborators, and for those in later stages to invite others to informally review the lesson and to try teaching the material. To submit your lesson to be featured in the series, follow the steps below.



1. Think about how you can prepare your lesson for new contributors before the feature is published. This might mean labelling existing issues (e.g. to appear on [the Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/)) or creating new ones, making sure that your CONTRIBUTING.md is up-to-date, and/or planning publication of the Spotlight feature to fit with a relatively quiet period in your schedule so that you can respond promptly to any new issues and pull requests.
2. Fill in [the Incubator Lesson Spotlight content submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJimGMtzqAFE-Tii-LvbfGZqtKj0OC4ken7_Qdlta8uZXAUA/viewform), providing details of the lesson to be included in the feature. It may be beneficial to collaborate on this content with other developers working on the lesson. The Carpentries Core Team will use the content provided in the form to create a post for [The Carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/) and an item for the[ Carpentries Clippings newsletter](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/).
3. When the blog post has been drafted, a pull request will be opened to add that post to the website. You will be tagged for an (optional) review of this pull request before it is published. To review the blog post, read through the post content and comment on the issue thread to request any changes to the feature.


### Submitting a Lesson to The Carpentries Lab

The Carpentries Lab hosts community-developed lessons that have been peer reviewed and can be relied upon by Instructors to meet a high standard of quality and stability. The Lab provides a platform for open peer review of lessons, and to promote the lessons that have entered the collection. 

To submit a lesson for peer review in The Carpentries Lab, follow these steps:



1. Check [the eligibility criteria for lessons to be reviewed in the Lab](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews#what-makes-a-lesson-a-good-candidate-for-the-carpentries-lab).
2. [Open a new issue on the Reviews repository](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-submission&template=submission.md&title=%5BREV%5D%3A+) and answer the questions in the issue template to tell the Editors about the lesson.


### Piloting a Lesson

Teaching a lesson for the first time is very rewarding, but the experience of the Instructors and learners also identifies opportunities to address and further clarify parts of the content. This makes early lesson teachings, which we refer to as _lesson pilots_, crucial milestones in the development of a high-quality lesson. As well as teaching new and exciting skills to learners, the additional purpose of pilot workshops is to collect information and feedback that can be used to polish content and make the lesson more reusable by other Instructors (e.g. by recording accurate timings for episodes and exercises, expanding Instructor Notes, etc.).


#### Alpha and Beta Pilots

The lesson development process includes pilot workshops at two different stages, which we refer to as _alpha_ and _beta_ pilots. Alpha pilots are the first workshops where the lesson is taught, almost always by some or all of the original developers of the lesson.

After the feedback from these alpha pilots has been used to improve the lesson, it can enter the beta stage, where other Instructors - who did not have a major part in the previous development of the lesson - teach it and provide feedback.

Information about these pilots, and the requirements for piloting official Carpentries lessons, can be found in the [Lesson Life Cycle chapter of The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html).


#### Information for Lesson Developers


##### Finding Hosts for Beta Pilots

If you are developing a new official Carpentries lesson - a lesson developed based on prior agreement with The Carpentries, and is intended to become another lesson/curriculum offered in centrally-organised workshops - the Curriculum Team will help you find hosts and Instructors for pilot workshops.

If you are developing a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator, you can recruit pilot hosts by putting out a call via [the discuss TopicBox list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss), [the general channel on The Carpentries Slack workspace](https://carpentries.org/connect/), [by publishing a post on our blog](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/guides/submit_blog_post.html), and/or by any other communications channel that you think appropriate (e.g. the mailing list of a specific community likely to be interested in the lesson topic). You may find this [template blog post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z8QmxDIiew-p1d8aLzXa0vt0FLUHNtK3oS3tucyrRsI/edit?usp=sharing) and/or this [template email message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHnm-Ljb_o_rNd9bvQ83ilq40KoGoEfMPTSrFS4QOj8/edit?usp=sharing) helpful starting points. If after taking these steps, you need help finding hosts to pilot your lesson, or if you have any questions about the lesson pilot process for lessons in The Carpentries Incubator, you can contact the [Incubator administrator team](mailto:incubator@carpentries.org). 


##### Collecting Feedback on the Lesson

Feedback from learners will be a valuable source of information about and suggestions for how your lesson could be further improved after the pilot. The standard Carpentries pre- and post-workshop surveys do not support lesson pilots so you will need to create your own surveys to send out before/after a pilot workshop. Although surveys for pilot workshops will frequently include questions that are specific to the particular lesson being piloted, there are some standard feedback questions that can be asked after a pilot to assess the design and flow of the lesson. This [template post-pilot workshop survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview) can be copied and adapted to your lesson, and shared with learners in place of the standard post-workshop survey.

It is also important to gather information about the lesson while it is being taught. Check [the Lesson Life Cycle chapter of The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html#field-testing-alpha-stage) for a list of things to take note of during the pilot workshop. We recommend assigning a specific person or people to keep track of these points (e.g. an Instructor or Helper). You may find it helpful to make a copy of [the pilot observation notes template](https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template) to use during the workshop.


#### Information for Hosts


##### Recruiting Instructors for Beta Pilots

If you are hosting a pilot of a new official Carpentries lesson - a lesson developed based on prior agreement with The Carpentries, and which is intended to become another lesson/curriculum offered in centrally-organised workshops - the Curriculum Team will help you find Instructors for pilot workshops.

The Carpentries is also keen to support the development and piloting of lessons in The Carpentries Incubator. If you are hosting a pilot of a lesson in the Incubator, we ask that you **first** try to find Instructors for pilot workshops yourself. Often, hosts are able to recruit certified Instructors from their local community with relevant knowledge of the lesson topic, but in some cases this will not be possible. If you wish to recruit Instructors for a pilot workshop, try putting a call out on [local/regional community mailing lists](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups), any relevant channels on [The Carpentries Slack workspace](https://carpentries.org/connect/) (the lesson authors may be able to direct you to these), and/or [by publishing a post on our blog](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/guides/submit_blog_post.html). Please do not post calls for Instructors to the general or instructors channel on Slack, or the discuss and instructors lists on TopicBox. Any messages to recruit Instructors will be removed from those channels. If after taking these steps, you find that you need help finding Instructors for your lesson pilot, you can email the [Incubator administrator team](mailto:incubator@carpentries.org) for assistance.


##### Creating a Pilot Workshop Webpage

[The Carpentries workshop webpage template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) supports the creation of webpages for pilot workshops. [The Customisation page of the template documentation](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/customization/#configuration-file-_configyml) has instructions on how to configure the webpage for a pilot workshop.

If you are piloting a new official Carpentries lesson - a lesson developed based on prior agreement with The Carpentries, and which is intended to become another lesson/curriculum offered in centrally-organised workshops - please [register your pilot as a Self-Organised Workshop](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/). If you do not find the lesson/curriculum being piloted listed as one of the choices on that form, please contact [The Carpentries Core Team](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

For workshops teaching lessons in The Carpentries Incubator, you should create a workshop webpage but should not submit the workshop details to The Carpentries team via the form linked above. Instead, if you want to tell the community about your event you can do so by filling in the form under _Workshops_ on [The Incubator homepage](https://carpentries-incubator.org/). Workshops submitted there will be processed by the Curriculum Team and will be listed in the table on that page.
