# Community Discussion Hosts 

##  Description of Community Role  

Hosting a community discussion is a great way to meet more people in The Carpentries community, get to know the organisation better, learn from the experiences of others and share your own knowledge and experience with an even greater number of people. 

Community discussions are also an integral part of our [Instructor Training Certification Process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/), also known as ‘Checkout’. As a Community Discussion Host, you get to welcome new Instructors into our global community and introduce them to community discussions as an ongoing resource for support and advice as they develop their teaching practices. 

Topics covered during community discussions range from teaching workshops and developing curricula to building local communities and assessing the impact of our workshops globally. There are four types:

1. **_Pre- and Post-Workshop Discussions:_** These discussions are designed for those getting ready to teach or having recently taught to come to discuss their workshop with the community.
2. **_Themed Community Discussions:_** These discussions are centred around a particular topic ranging from teaching your first workshop to community-building strategies. Each month, the Community Development Team hosts **_Welcome Sessions_** for new community members to meet members of the Core Team and learn about ways to engage with the organisation.
3. **_Carpentries Conversations:_** These Conversations are hosted by one of our Committees or Task Forces to provide the community with the opportunity to learn about and discuss new developments and programs in our organisation. 
4. **_Regional Community Calls:_** These calls are hosted by our local and regional subcommunities. A list of local and regional calls can be found at the top of the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions)

**Note.** Any of these four types of Community Discussions can be attended to meet the requirement as part of [Instructor Training Certification (‘Checkout’)](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/).

### Roles and Responsibilities

A community member can serve as a community discussion host for any length of time, considering their availability and interest. Specific responsibilities include:

* Attend one onboarding session, lasting one hour.
* Sign-up to receive relevant communications for serving in this role. Instructions for signing up can be found in the [Communication and Collaboration Spaces section of this handbook]
* During a quarterly scheduling period, schedule one or more community discussions on the date(s)/time(s) you want to host a discussion.
* Facilitate one-hour community discussion sessions that you have signed up to host.
* Make space for participation from anyone attending as part of ‘Checkout’. While participation is not a requirement for checkout, we want to make sure new community members feel welcome and get their questions answered. On the sign up list, these people will have included the word checkout next to their name.
* Complete [a brief form](https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7) following each session you host. **It is important that when you copy attendance into this form, you include the word ‘checkout’ next to the names where it appears in the sign-up on the Etherpad. The Core Team uses this information to record participation in AMY, The Carpentries internal database. This is the primary way future Instructors get credit for completing this checkout step.  **

### Onboarding

If you are interested in becoming a community discussion host, you can [email the Community Development Team](mailto:community@carpentries.org) to inform them of your interest. They will provide you with the date and time of the next onboarding session. Onboarding sessions are offered in multiple time zones each quarter as a themed community discussion. [A video](https://youtu.be/VrWdzlD2dlE) and [accompanying slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mal-KCfz5EaPuXXMCRiYxYsA41qPsWJfnj9ydMo9Y8Q/edit?usp=sharing) that include the content covered in the onboarding are available as references to support you as you serve in this role. Once you are onboarded, you may want to first attend a community discussion as an observer or co-host before leading a call as the host. 

### Offboarding

If you are no longer interested in serving as a Community Discussion Host, please send an [email to the Community Development Team](mailto:community@carpentries.org). They will remove you from the #discussion-host Slack channel and unsubscribe you from the Discussion Host mailing list. 

##  Communication and Collaboration Spaces

This section includes a list of communication channels and collaboration spaces that support Community Discussion Hosts. Participants in these spaces are expected to follow The Carpentries [code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). A description of the tools listed can be found in [the community glossary](https://github.com/carpentries/community-development/blob/main/glossary.md). 

### Community Calendar

Once you have scheduled to host a call, a calendar invite will be sent to the email address that you used when signing up. All community discussions will also be listed on our [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events). 

### Etherpad

A list of Etherpads relevant to serving as a Community Discussion Host include: 

* [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions): This Etherpad contains a list of all upcoming community discussions where community members can sign up to attend and find login information for joining a session.
* [Pad-of-pads](https://pad.carpentries.org/pad-of-pads): A list of The Carpentries most commonly used Etherpads and other resources.

### Messaging and Communication

Slack is the software platform used by The Carpentries to support synchronous and asynchronous communications. Channels support communications, collaboration and co-creation among a subset of community members, depending on the channel’s purpose. You can [join The Carpentries Slack workspace](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) to follow conversations on the channel relevant to this role: 

* #discussion-hosts: channel for Community Discussion Hosts and those interested in hosting community discussions 

If Slack is new to you, our [Slack Quick Start Guide](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html#slack-quick-start-guide) will help you to set up your profile and give you an overview of how we use the platform on a day-to-day basis.

### Mailing List

You can access all The Carpentries mailing lists from [TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/latest). The [Community Discussion Host mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discussion-hosts) is the one relevant to serving in this role. To join one or more Carpentries mailing lists, you will need to [create a login on the site](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/latest). Once you have done this, you can review the list of groups and select “Join the Conversation” (for open mailing) or “Request to Join” (for those mailing lists requiring administrator approval).

* Community Discussion Hosts will sign up using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) during the signup period. Calendly allows you to select dates and times in your timezone for the sessions you plan to host. Dates and times already selected will not display. 
* Once hosts have scheduled themselves for a Community Discussion via Calendly, an automated workflow will add each event to the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) and the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events). Another communication from the Community Development Team will inform hosts when the sessions have been added.
* In the rare instance that you need to schedule a session outside of the quarterly scheduling period, the Community Discussion Host should complete the [Request to Schedule and Facilitate Carpentries Community Discussion form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen9_axxQ3_0FN5HjL7cyot9RzTdIGpOU16Wr1eatZblsfU7w/viewform). The session is not confirmed until the host is contacted by a member of the Community Development Team.

### Signing Up to Host a Regional Community Call

Community Coordinators are responsible for scheduling and hosting Regional Community Calls. These calls are currently listed, with their date and time, at the top of the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) and include a link to where the group records their call notes. If a Community Coordinator is interested in listing a Regional Community Call there and having it added to The Carpentries Community Calendar, they should email [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org). If they instead want to have the call added to the Community Discussion Etherpad where individuals can sign up to attend and collaboratively take notes, they can add the events using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) during the signup period as described in the [Signing Up to Host a Community Discussion Session section of this handbook](#signing-up-to-host-a-community-discussion). This will automatically add the event to the Community Calendar and to the Etherpad. To learn more about becoming a Community Coordinator, please visit 
[the FAQs section of this handbook](#faq). 

### Checklist for Hosting a Community Discussion

Community discussions use the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) where community members can sign up to attend and collaboratively take notes during the call. Many regional subcommunities use their own notetaking platform for Regional Community Calls, and links to where they record notes can be found at the top of the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) and are also available in the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events) listing. 


#### Before the Discussion Session



* Sign on at least 5 minutes before the beginning of the discussion session.
* It is recommended to create a waiting room. This enables the host to explicitly let people in, rather than allowing anyone to enter. 
    * [Learn about how to enable and use a waiting room as host.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room#h_f493a86f-7d08-4e3b-9d6d-9b236fe9cdcd)
* Gain host access.
    * Two days before the event, the host will receive an automated email from Calendly that includes the host key.
    * [Learn about how to use the host key to claim host access.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001315866)
* Enable closed captioning to improve accessibility of the event.
    * Zoom provides automatic captioning of calls. Accuracy of captioning may be limited due to factors such as sound quality, accents, dialects, and jargon.
    * [Learn about how to enable automatic captioning.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Managing-Zoom-closed-captioning-and-live-transcription-services)
* Confirm that the fellow host is present (if there is one) and who will be leading/taking notes.
* If relevant, the host can copy the template agendas for all session types from the bottom of the [Community Discussion Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) to the space under the sign up for the session. [Template agendas](#sample-agendas) are also available in this handbook. 


#### During the Discussion Session



* Use or adapt the [Script for Starting a Community Discussion](#script-for-starting-a-community-discussion).
* If relevant, follow the sample agendas provided at the bottom of the [Community Discussion Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) and also available in the [resources section of this handbook](#resources). 
    * We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but you can let the discussion go where people want. Not all the questions need to be answered by everyone.
    * The host should not feel like they have to answer all the questions. They should draw on the other discussion participants to answer each other’s questions.
    * If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to ask a question.
    * Try to leave enough time in the end for Q&A and any announcements that need to be made.
* Take notes or identify someone to take notes.
* For pre-and post-workshop discussions: If there are more than 5 workshops represented by attendees, we recommend splitting participants into two groups using breakout rooms to make sure everyone has enough time to share. When dividing attendees into two groups, try to balance the number of people who are de-briefing, who are there for pre-workshop help, and who are instructor trainees. [Learn more about how to set up and use breakout rooms](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#creating-breakout-rooms).  

#### After the Discussion Session

* Archive the Etherpad by selecting “Save Revision” (Note: displays as a star in the top right menu).
* Fill out the [host form](https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7).
    * Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but removing no-shows) and paste it into the form. Be sure that anyone who attended for checkout has checkout written next to their name. 
    * When submitted, this form will automatically send an email to [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) so all checkout requirements can be recorded.
* Clear the information from the session (date/time, attendees, notes) from the Etherpad.
* (Optional) [Write a blog post](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/guides/submit_blog_post.html) about interesting points that came up in discussion.

#### Cancelling a Discussion Session

We recognise that even after scheduling community discussions, the host may have conflicts that arise that require cancelling a scheduled event. If this happens, please contact [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org) as soon as possible so a Core Team member can ensure another host is able to cover the event. You can also post to one or more of the [Communication and Collaboration Spaces](#communication-and-collaboration-spaces) to learn if another host is available to lead the call.

##  FAQ

**What if I am hosting a discussion and there are no pre/post workshop debriefs?**

You could start by introducing the session and what it should be about. You could also give some feedback on your own experience in previous workshops and/or upcoming workshops that you are a part of.

**What if I do not know the answer to someone’s questions and no one in the room does either?**

It is totally fine if you do not know all the answers. This is a great time to demonstrate how someone in the community can get their questions answered by posting the question to Slack or one of The Carpentries mailing list. Questions can always be sent to [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) and a member of the Core Team will respond.

**What if the host/co-host has a poor internet connection and is unable to communicate? What if Zoom fails to work (e.g. your internet connection fails)?**

It is very important to test your internet connection beforehand and to make sure that you as a host are able to communicate. The host is the session leader and should have a stable connection. If, however, when you test your connection, you find that you do not have a good connection, contact the community via [our communication channels](#communication-and-collaboration-spaces) to find out if someone could take over as host for the session. 

**What if no one shows up?**

If no one shows up, send out a reminder email to participants who signed up and wait for a few minutes. If now one shows up by :10 after the start of the session, then fill in [the host form](https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7) and indicate that no one showed up for your session.

**What if someone talks too much?**

Limit the amount of time that you give participants to ask and answer questions. You could ask for feedback from someone who has not shared yet to engage everyone in the conversation.

**What if there is no co-host/note taker and the session is fully booked?**

As a host, you are more than welcome to take a few notes, however, there is no need to take down every single thing that is shared. Note down important points, making sure to add links to useful information. Encourage participants to contribute to the notes on the Community Discussions Etherpad.

**What if someone joins in late?**

Depending on how late the person joins, you could welcome them and ask them to introduce themselves to the rest of the participants. If you have time, you can ask the individual to stay on the call for a few minutes after it is finished to summarise what they missed and answer any questions they may have.

**What if someone does not have a headset and can’t control their background noise?**

As a host, you will have the privilege to mute other participants, or you could ask the person directly to mute their microphone. [Learn more about how to use host features in Zoom](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#information-for-event-hosts).

**What if I forget to complete the host questionnaire?**

Participants will not have updated profiles that indicate completion of this checkout requirement, and it will take a lot of administration to solve this issue. Please remember to fill in the form directly after hosting your session.

**What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct? What if someone had a report of misconduct?**

In the case that this happens, [The Carpentries has a set of guidelines that can be followed](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html).

**What if one person doesn’t contribute to the conversation?**

Try to encourage participation. This can be done by asking participants a question or asking a person for their thoughts on a specific topic of conversation. There is also a point in the agenda that allows you as the host to talk to participants and ask them each for a specific question that they need answering.

**What if someone asks to join my Community Discussion session to complete their instructor checkout session and it is already full?**

Participants can email the host and ask to join the session even though it is fully booked. It is up to your personal discretion as to whether or not you accept additional participants.

**What if someone is loud/obnoxious and/or talks down to other people?**

It is very important to remind everyone of the Code of Conduct at the beginning of each session as The Carpentries adheres to it during all community events, including community discussions. Such behavior would be a clear violation and you could ask the person to leave.

**What if I am having trouble understanding one of the attendees?**

You could ask the participant to type their questions in the Community Discussions Etherpad for you to read and respond to them, which will also make note-taking much easier. Consider asking them to speak up as well if the microphone is too soft.

**What if I need to create a separate Etherpad for note-taking?**

Notes from all sessions can be taken on the Community Discussions Etherpad and will be archived following each discussion. However, if you think another Etherpad is needed for notetaking during your session, a new Etherpad can be created by appending a descriptive name to the url https://pad.carpentries.org/, such as https://pad.carpentries.org/themed-discussion-15-09-2022.

**How can I become a Community Coordinator?**

A Community Coordinator is a member of the community who serves as the leader of a subcommunity within The Carpentries. This role is being formalized through the Community Development Program. If you are interested in learning more, please email [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org).
